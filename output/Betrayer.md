name: [[Betrayer]]
type: General
description: You can charm people into lowering their defenses, allowing you to ambush them more effectively.
prerequisites: [[Quick Draw]], [[Persuasive]], base attack bonus +3.
prerequisite_feats: [[Quick Draw]], [[Persuasive]]
benefit: When you succeed at a Diplomacy check to change a creature's attitude, you can draw a weapon and make a single melee attack against that creature as an immediate action. If you changed your target's attitude to friendly or better, your target is considered flat-footed against this attack. If the target survives, it takes a -2 penalty on its initiative check for this combat. Once you attack a creature, its attitude becomes hostile.
