name: [[Bloody [[Vengeance]]]]
type: Combat
description: Your retaliatory strikes have long-lasting effects.
prerequisites: Worshiper of [[Calistria]], base attack bonus +1.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: If an opponent has damaged you within the past minute, you may study that opponent as a standard action. Thereafter, if you hit that creature with a melee attack, the target takes 1 point of bleed damage each round at the start of its turn. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 [[Heal]] check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. [[Bleed]] damage does not stack. [[Bleed]] damage bypasses any damage reduction the creature might possess.
