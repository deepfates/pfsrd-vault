Description: This buckler-sized mirror magnifies flaws and faults, presenting the least appealing image of any creature reflected in it. The mirror must be held in one hand to function. As a standard action three times per day, the bearer of the mirror can project a reflection onto the creature that produced it, making them appear utterly loathsome to all onlookers. The subject must be within 30 feet of the mirror, and must be able to see the mirror to be affected. For the next 5 rounds any creature attempting to target the subject with a beneficial spell or effect must make a DC 14 Will save. On a failure, the creature must choose a new subject for the spell or effect is wasted. Once a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it can target the subject normally for the remainder of the mirror's effect's duration.
