Name: [[Sword Of Valor]]
Aura: strong abjuration and evocation [good]
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: The Inheritor herself carried this crimson banner into battle during the Shining Crusade. An army commander who carries the Sword of Valor increases the DV and OM of her army by 4 against armies of undead or evil outsiders. Yet the Sword of Valor's greatest [[power]] lies not in offense but in defense. [[Mount]]ed firmly upon an interior wall in a visible, public place, the Sword of Valor creates a 10-mile-radius area that bars demons and those who worship demons from using teleportation spells and effects and imparts on such creatures a -4 penalty to Armor Class and on all saving throws. Once per month while the banner is mounted on a wall, a worshiper of [[Iomedae]] within 30 feet of the banner can use it to summon a planetar to protect the banner and its surroundings for 1 day. Any nonevil creature that sleeps within a 1-mile radius becomes immune to fear effects from demons and demon worshipers for 24 hours.
