benefit: Whenever you charge an opponent from higher ground, or from above while flying, the critical multiplier of your weapon increases by 2 (to a maximum of x6).

If your charge attack hits, you can perform a trip combat maneuver against the attack's target as a free action without provoking attacks of opportunity.
