Name: [[Forge Fist Amulet]]
Aura: faint evocation
CL: 6
Slot: neck
Price: 13,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This fist-shaped stone amulet glows with a fiery light. On command, this amulet causes the wearer's fists to transform into red-hot flaming adamantine. The wearer is protected from the searing heat and can make savage blows with his hands. Unarmed strikes and natural attacks the wearer make with his hands gain the flaming weapon special ability and are treated as adamantine for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction (but not hardness). The wearer's hands become rigid while using this amulet and cannot be use to hold or manipulate objects (unless that manipulation could be accomplished with a club and is not damaged by fire). The transformation can be ended as a swift action.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]]; greater magic fang; and flame blade, flame strike, or fireball
Cost: 6,500 gp
