prerequisites: [[Disruptive]].
prerequisite_feats: [[Disruptive]]
benefit: The DC to cast spells defensively within your threatened area increases by half your tier. This stacks with the increase granted by [[Disruptive]]. In addition, even if you can't make attacks of opportunity, non-mythic spellcasters are still wary of you and continue to suffer from the effects of [[Disruptive]].
