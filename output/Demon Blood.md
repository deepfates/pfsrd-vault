Name: [[Demon Blood]]
Aura: faint evocation [evil]
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 800 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: A character who drinks a dose of this black, bubbling ichor becomes nauseated for 1d6 rounds if he fails a DC 15 Fortitude save. He also gains an enhanced capacity to affect demons with his magical attacks for 1 hour-during this time, demons suffer a -2 penalty on their saving throws against the user's spells and spell-like abilities, and the user gains a +2 bonus on caster level checks made to penetrate a demon's spell resistance. Demon blood is somewhat addictive, and every day for a week after a user stops daily doses of the ichor, he must make a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid taking 1 point of Wisdom damage and being sickened for the entire day.
