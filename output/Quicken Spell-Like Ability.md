name: [[Quicken Spell]]-Like Ability
type: Monster
description: This creature can use one of its spell-like abilities with next to no effort.
prerequisites: Spell-like ability at CL 10th or higher.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: Choose one of the creature's spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions described in this feat. The creature can use the chosen spell-like ability as a quickened spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). Using a quickened spell-like ability is a swift action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. The creature can perform another action-including the use of another spell-like ability (but not another swift action)-in the same round that it uses a quickened spell-like ability. The creature may use only one quickened spell-like ability per round. The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 its caster level (round down) - 4. For a summary, see the table on page 316. A spell-like ability that duplicates a spell with a casting time greater than 1 full round cannot be quickened.
normal: The use of a spell-like ability normally requires a standard action (at the very least) and provokes an attack of opportunity.
