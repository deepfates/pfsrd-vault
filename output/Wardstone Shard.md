Name: [[Wardstone]] Shard
Aura: Strong abjuration
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 1/2 lb.
Description: When the final fragment of the Kenabres wardstone shatters, a few tiny shards of the stone remain behind. The magic remaining in these fragments is fleeting, usable only once before the shard becomes an inert sliver of stone. As a standard action, a wardstone shard may be rubbed along a weapon or a suit of [[armor]] to transfer the shard's magic to the weapon or [[armor]] for 1 day. Weapon: A weapon enhanced by a wardstone shard gains the evil outsider bane quality, and is treated as being made of cold iron and as a good weapon for the purposes of overcoming a demon's damage reduction. The shard cannot be used to enhance ammunition in this manner, but can be used to enhance a weapon that fires ammunition; doing so causes the weapon to impart these qualities to the ammunition as it is fired. Armor: A suit of [[armor]] enhanced by a wardstone shard gains the spell resistance (13) [[armor]] special ability, but only against evil outsiders. Against demons, this spell resistance increases to 17. A nonmagical suit of [[armor]] also gains a +1 enhancement bonus as well.
