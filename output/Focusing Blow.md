name: [[Focusing Blow]]
type: General
description: You and your allies work together to shake off mental effects.
prerequisites: [[Hobgoblin Discipline]], hobgoblin.
prerequisite_feats: [[Hobgoblin Discipline]]
benefit: An ally who also has this feat can deal damage to you in order to break an ongoing mind-affecting effect that allows a saving throw. The ally must cause at least 5 points of damage to you with an attack, spell, or other ability. You then reroll your saving throw, with a +1 bonus for every 5 additional points of damage the attack caused. If your save is successful, the mind-affecting effect ends. Only damage actually dealt counts for purposes of this feat; nonlethal damage and damage reduced or eliminated by damage reduction, resistances, and so on does not qualify.
