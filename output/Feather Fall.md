description: The affected creatures or objects fall slowly. Feather fall instantly changes the rate at which the targets fall to a mere 60 feet per round (equivalent to the end of a fall from a few feet), and the subjects take no damage upon landing while the spell is in effect. When the spell duration expires, a normal rate of falling resumes. The spell affects one or more [[Medium]] or smaller creatures (including gear and carried objects up to each creature's maximum load) or objects, or the equivalent in larger creatures: a Large creature or object counts as two [[Medium]] creatures or objects, a Huge creature or object counts as four [[Medium]] creatures or objects, and so forth. This spell has no special effect on ranged weapons unless they are falling quite a distance. If the spell is cast on a falling item, the object does half normal damage based on its weight, with no bonus for the height of the drop. Feather fall works only upon free-falling objects. It does not affect a sword blow or a charging or flying creature.
