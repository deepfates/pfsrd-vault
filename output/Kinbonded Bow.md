Description: This stout +1 longbow is engraved with images of leaping deer. Designed to prevent inaccuracy while hunting in a group, the bow is imbued with magic that allows the wielder to accurately shoot past an ally. At will, the wielder can spend 1 minute attuning the bow to a touched ally. Thereafter, that ally no longer provides soft cover against ranged attacks with the kinbonded bow (Core Rulebook 196). Only one ally can be attuned to the bow at a time.
