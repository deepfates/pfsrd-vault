Name: [[Chalice Of Ozem]]
Aura: strong abjuration and evocation [force]
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This chalice is perhaps the last surviving artifact from Sacred Ozem, now forever lost in a tragic battle that ultimately led to the foundation of the Knights of Ozem. Made of shimmering mithral and studded with dozens of rubies, the Chalice of Ozem was carried from the ruins and handed down through generations until it was finally given to [[Iomedae]], who used it in her fight against Erum-Hel during the Battle of Three Sorrows. The chalice cannot be harmed by any substance it holds, no matter how caustic. Further, any liquid placed within the chalice will never spill unless the chalice's carrier wills it. If the chalice is held and the command phrase spoken ("Ozem for [[Iomedae]]!"), it projects a globe of invulnerability. If a second command phrase is spoken ("Her sheltering shield!") and a scooping motion is made with the chalice, a resilient sphere is created around the carrier. Each of these effects can be called upon twice per day. Once per day, a mythic character can expend one use of mythic [[power]] while pouring a dose of holy water into the chalice to immediately transform that dose of holy water into a single dose of nectar of the gods ( Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 155).
