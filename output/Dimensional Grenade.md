Price: 1,450 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This M1914 concussion grenade (see page 66) can be thrown up to 680 feet away, as it teleports itself directly to the target location when thrown. This allows a dimensional grenade to be thrown even at targets behind cover, including total cover. The wielder does not need to attempt an attack roll; the dimensional grenade simply appears in the target location and detonates at the beginning the wielder's next turn. A dimensional grenade deals 3d6 points of force damage in a 15-foot radius (Reflex DC 15 for half). In addition, any creature damaged by the grenade's blast must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be dazed for 1 round. The grenade is consumed in the attack.
