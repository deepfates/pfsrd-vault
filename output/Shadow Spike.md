Name: [[Shadow Spike]]
Aura: strong conjuration
CL: 12
Slot: item
Price: 96,600 gp
Weight: 4 lbs.
Description: This +2/+2 cruel quarterstaff is made of polished ebony, and features a blackened metal spike on its bottom end. As a standard action, the wielder can drive the spike into the ground on either the Material Plane or the Shadow Plane, creating a rift merging those two planes. This rift is 30 feet in diameter, lasts for 1 minute, and can be created once per day. If the creature that drives the shadow spike into the ground expends one use of mythic [[power]] when doing so, the effect lasts until the shadow spike is pulled out of the ground (which takes a standard action). The rift's area acts as the deeper darkness spell. Spells with the darkness or shadow descriptors cast within the rift have +1 caster level, and are affected as if cast with the [[Extend Spell]] feat. As a standard action, any mythic creature within the area can expend three uses of mythic [[power]] to plane shift to the Shadow Plane (if on the Material Plane) or to the Material Plane (if on the Shadow Plane). If a mythic creature plane shifts while holding the shadow spike, the weapon teleports with that creature, ending the effect.
