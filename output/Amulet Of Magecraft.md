Description: A universalist [[wizard]] who selects the amulet as his bonded object may choose one school of spells each day when he prepares spells. He then can use the necklace to spontaneously convert any prepared [[wizard]] spell of that school into any other [[wizard]] spell of that school he knows- though the desired spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell. For example, if the [[wizard]] chooses evocation when he prepares his spells that morning, until the next time he prepares spells, he can spontaneously convert a prepared fireball into any other evocation [[wizard]] spell of 3rd level or lower that he knows.
