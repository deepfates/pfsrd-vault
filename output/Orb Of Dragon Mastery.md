Name: Orb Of [[Dragon]] Mastery
Aura: strong enchantment
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 4 lbs.
Description: These grim orbs swirl hypnotically with shades of crimson and the color of the draconic breed whose minds they can ensnare. The bearer of an Orb of [[Dragon]] Mastery can, as a standard action, dominate dragons of the orb's particular variety within 250 feet (as dominate monster), the target dragon being forced to make a DC 23 Will save to resist. Spell resistance is not useful against this effect. By steeping the orb for 1 hour in the blood of a true dragon that has been dead for no more than a day, the DC to resist the orb's dominate monster effect can be increased by an amount equal to the slain dragon's age category. (Thus, steeping the orb in the blood of an old dragon would increase the DC by +8.) This bonus decreases by -1 every day until the orb returns to its normal DC or is again steeped in a dragon's blood. An Orb of [[Dragon]] Mastery cannot be steeped in the blood of multiple dragons for an increased benefit. The blood may come from any breed of true dragon, not just dragons of the orb's color.
