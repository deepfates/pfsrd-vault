name: [[Augment Summoning]]
type: Mythic
description: Your summoning spells bring not mere ordinary beasts, but instead mythic creatures.
prerequisites: [[Augment Summoning]].
prerequisite_feats: [[Augment Summoning]]
benefit: Any creature you summon using a summon spell is considered mythic for the purpose of interacting with other mythic creatures. It doesn't gain any mythic abilities or [[power]], but is affected by mythic spells and abilities as if it were a 1st-tier mythic creature. Additionally, if the creature summoned has damage reduction, its damage reduction becomes DR/epic.
