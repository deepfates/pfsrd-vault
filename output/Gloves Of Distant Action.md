Name: [[Gloves Of Distant Action]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 9
Slot: hands
Price: 20,000 gp
Weight: -
Description: As a move action, the wearer of these fine leather gloves can pick up an unattended object (weighing no more than 20 pounds) that is up to 30 feet away, and move it up to 30 feet. The object falls to the ground at the end of the movement unless the wearer of the gloves moves it into his hand. This action doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. By expending one use of mythic [[power]] as a free action on his turn, the wearer can [[focus]] the [[power]] of the gloves, allowing him to make unarmed strikes and combat maneuvers to bull rush, disarm, or trip against foes up to 30 feet away until the end of his turn. Treat these attacks as though the wearer had 30 feet of reach. When attacking a non-adjacent target in this manner, the wearer can't be affected by feats and abilities like [[Strike Back]] or fire shield that require touching or coming near the target. The gloves don't increase the wearer's threatened area.
