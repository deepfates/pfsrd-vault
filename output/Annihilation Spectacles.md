Description: Creatures viewed through these darkly tinted glasses sometimes seem to flicker briefly in and out of existence. A transmuter can use these spectacles to spontaneously convert any prepared [[wizard]] transmutation spell into any other [[wizard]] transmutation spell he knows; the desired spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell. Once per day, he may use the spectacles to spontaneously cast disintegrate in place of one of his prepared transmutation [[wizard]] spells of 6th level or higher, even if he doesn't know that spell.
