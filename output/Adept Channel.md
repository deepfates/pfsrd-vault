name: [[Adept]] Channel
type: General
description: Some orc adepts enjoy a greater connection to their gods, and can channel their faith through their unholy symbols. You gain the ability to channel energy as a [[cleric]].
prerequisites: Ability to cast divine spells, summon familiar class ability, caster level 4th, Cha 13.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: You gain the channel energy class feature, as a [[cleric]], usable 2 times per day. This ability otherwise functions like the [[cleric]]'s channel energy ability, except that your effective [[cleric]] level is equal to your divine spellcasting class level -3. Unlike a [[cleric]], however, the number of times per day you may channel energy is not affected by your Charisma modifier.
