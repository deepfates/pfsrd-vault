Description: This short aspergillum is made of silver. An [[inquisitor]] who carries it may use detect undead as if it were one of the spells associated with her detect alignment ability. Once per day, the item can alter an [[inquisitor]]'s judgment ability; by spending one use of her judgment ability, she can allow her spells of 3rd level and lower to have full effect against incorporeal creatures, as though using the [[Ectoplasmic Spell]] feat. This lasts until the combat ends.
