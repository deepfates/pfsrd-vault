prerequisite_feats: [[Improved Grapple]], [[Improved Unarmed Strike]]
benefit: You receive a +2 bonus on checks made to grapple a foe. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by [[Improved Grapple]]. Once you have grappled a creature, maintaining the grapple is a move action. This feat allows you to make two grapple checks each round (to move, harm, or pin your opponent), but you are not required to make two checks. You only need to succeed at one of these checks to maintain the grapple.
normal: Maintaining a grapple is a standard action.
