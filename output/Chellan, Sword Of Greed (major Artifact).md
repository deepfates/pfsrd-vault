Name: [[[[Chellan, Sword Of Greed]] (major Artifact)]]
Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 16
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 25 lbs.
Description: Of the Seven Blades of [[Conviction]] wielded by the runelords' champions-weapons known as the Alara'hai to the Thassilonians, the sword of greed was the most extravagant-for it was made of magically hardened gold, tempered to the strength of adamantine yet retaining its luster. Although made of gold, Chellan functions as an adamantine weapon for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness. Chellan is a +5 keen scimitar, and its density allows it to damage foes as if it were one size category larger than its actual size. It can be properly wielded only by characters with a Strength of 18 or higher-all other characters must either wield it as a two-handed weapon or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls with the weapon. Whenever Chellan strikes a foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be slowed as per the spell slow (CL 16th). If the sword scores a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be turned into a crystalline statue, as if by flesh to stone. Characters turned to crystal by Chellan appear to be made of ruby, diamond, or some other valuable gem, but are in fact merely colored quartz of little value to looters. Fanatical in the extreme, Chellan seeks to force its wielder into serving Karzoug and furthering the runelord's goals. To enforce this purpose of their existence, it can use its intelligence and special abilities to aid and manipulate those who think to wield it.
