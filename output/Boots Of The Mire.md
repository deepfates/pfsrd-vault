Slot: feet
Price: 3,500 gp

Description: These soft leather boots confer several [[power]]s upon the wearer. First, he is granted the [[power]] to walk on water in swampy environments, provided the water is no deeper than 5 feet-this effectively lets him move through swampy terrain and mud at no cost to his speed. He leaves no tracks or other signs of his passage as long as he's in swampy terrain, and never becomes uncomfortable or wet from rain, fog, or other forms of non-freezing precipitation. Finally, the boots grant him a +2 resistance bonus on all Fortitude saves made against poison and disease.
