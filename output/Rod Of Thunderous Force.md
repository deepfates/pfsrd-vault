Name: [[Rod Of Thunderous Force]]
Aura: moderate evocation
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 5,400 gp
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This mahogany rod is etched with the image of whirling storm clouds. Once per day on command, the wielder can slam the rod against the ground, releasing a concussive wave of sonic and force energy. This creates a 20-foot radius burst centered on the wielder. While it causes no damage, those within the burst must succeed at a DC 19 Fortitude save or fall prone and be deafened for 1d4 rounds. The wielder is unaffected by this blast. This effect is a force and sonic effect.
