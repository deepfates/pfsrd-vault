Description: [[Serithtial]] is a +4 holy Zon-Kuthon bane bastard sword used in several crusades from [[Cheliax]] against [[Nidal]], and finally used by the hero Mandraivus in his assault on Scarwall. Although made of steel, [[Serithtial]] is treated as being made of both cold iron and silver for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction. [[Serithtial]] glows with the equivalent of continual flame, but her wielder can extinguish or ignite this glow as a move action. In addition, the weapon gains a further +2 enhancement bonus and deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against foes who serve or worship Zon-Kuthon. Although [[Serithtial]] is lawful good, as long as her wielder is dedicated to the defeat of the dragon Kazavon and those he has corrupted (see page 36), she does not attempt to seize control of her wielder. If her wielder does go against her wishes, she tries to force him to relinquish her to a more appropriate wielder.
