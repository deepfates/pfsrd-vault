Name: [[Armor Of The Pious]]
Aura: moderate abjuration [good]
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 23,300 gp
Weight: 25 lbs.
Description: This gold-plated +1 mithral full plate [[armor]] has images of [[Iomedae]]'s symbol etched into its immaculately gleaming surface. The [[armor]] requires 24 hours to attune itself to the wearer and her patron deity, after which point the images on the [[armor]] shift to match the symbol of the wearer's patron deity (or remain associated with [[Iomedae]] if the wearer doesn't worship a deity). Thereafter, once per day the [[armor]]'s wearer can offer a prayer to her deity (or [[Iomedae]]) as a swift action to increase the [[armor]]'s enhancement bonus to +2 for 10 rounds. For this duration, the [[armor]] also grants a +2 sacred bonus on saving throws. A [[paladin]] wearing [[armor]] of the pious can use her lay on hands ability one additional time per day; a mythic [[paladin]] wearing [[armor]] of the pious also gains one additional use of mythic [[power]] per day. An evil character who wears [[armor]] of the pious gains 2 negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the [[armor]] is worn and disappear when the [[armor]] is removed-they never become permanent but can't be overcome in any way as long as the [[armor]] is worn.
