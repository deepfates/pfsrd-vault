Description: These ornate military medals are awarded to crusaders and adventurers who excel and deserve commendation in the war against the [[Worldwound]]. A medal must be affixed to a worn article of clothing to function, but doesn't have to be worn visibly. Any number of righteous medals can be worn, but the effects of multiple medals of a single type don't stack. A righteous medal functions only if the wearer has legitimately achieved the feat for which she received the medal. As a swift action, the wearer can gain a +2 sacred bonus to the medal's associated ability score for 1 minute. In addition, each righteous medal grants a constant sacred bonus on one type of roll, as detailed below. Righteous Medal of Spirit: This rectangular medal depicts the symbol of [[Iomedae]] on a field of red. It is awarded to a hero who becomes possessed or mentally controlled by a demon but escapes from that control before he is forced to do evil. This medal is associated with Wisdom and grants a +2 sacred bonus on saves against charm and possession effects (including dominate effects). A mythic character who wears all six righteous medals gains one additional use of mythic [[power]] per day.
