Description: This immaculate +2 championUE field plateISWG is commonly used by military commanders in [[Lastwall]], [[Mendev]], and [[Taldor]]. A sturdy metal bracket is built onto the back of the [[armor]], located just under the shoulder blades; if the wielder has personal heraldry, this slot can hold a banner or flag bearing that heraldry (such as a [[cavalier]]'s banner). If the wearer of the war commander's field plate takes to the battlefield as an army commander (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Campaign 234), he gains the Hold the Line boon if he prominently displays his heraldry. If the wearer already possesses this boon, he instead gains an additional +1 bonus on Morale checks as army commander.
