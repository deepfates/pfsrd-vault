Description: This putrid green devil talisman grants you a telepathic link with an insidious lawful evil intelligence bound within. While wearing this talisman you gain a +4 Charisma bonus and are constantly under the effects of the spell foresight. Once per day as a free action, you may use commune, find the path, legend lore, and true strike. The devil bound within this talisman is a 45 HD pit fiend known as Aasdravox, a fiend both cunning and mighty. He speaks with a voice like grinding stones and tells the wearers of his talisman that they are destined to become great heroes and champions beloved by whole nations. Optimally, he seeks to release his [[power]] at the culmination of some festive triumph or ceremony held in his talisman wearer's honor.
