Description: This red elixir is always the temperature of freshly spilled blood. A creature can consume a gobbet of flesh and drink this liquid as a single standard action. If the drinker is an animal, it is stunned for 1 round, and must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or permanently acquire the man-eating animal template. If the blood of Baphomet is consumed with humanoid flesh, the animal receives no saving throw. If the drinker is not an animal, it enters a frenzy, as the rage spell. The drinker must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be confused for as long as it rages. If the blood of Baphomet is consumed with humanoid flesh (a chaotic evil act), the drinker receives no saving throw.
