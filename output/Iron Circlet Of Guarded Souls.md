Name: [[Iron Circlet Of Guarded Souls]]
Aura: moderate abjuration
CL: 11
Slot: head
Price: 30,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This simple cold iron circle has no markings or ornamentation upon it, and is always slightly cool to the touch. The circle shields both the wearer's soul and his identity from mystic intrusion. The wearer is immune to effects that target souls (such as trap the soul) or that would be foiled by a nondetection spell (unlike nondetection, the diviner's caster cannot attempt a spell resistance check to overcome this effect). If the wearer is slain, he cannot be restored to life by magic (save by a miracle, wish, or divine intervention) until the circlet is removed.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], nondetection, trap the soul
Cost: 15,000 gp
