name: [[Crossbow Mastery]]
type: Combat
description: You can load crossbows with blinding speed and even fire them in melee with little fear of reprisal.
prerequisites: Dex 15, [[Point-Blank Shot]], [[Rapid Reload]], [[Rapid Shot]].
prerequisite_feats: [[Point-Blank Shot]], [[Rapid Reload]], [[Rapid Shot]]
benefit: The time required for you to reload any type of crossbow is reduced to a free action, regardless of the type of crossbow used. You can fire a crossbow as many times in a full attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow. Reloading a crossbow for the type of crossbow you chose when you took [[Rapid Reload]] no longer provokes attacks of opportunity.
