Name: [[Kybwa'ka War Mask]]
Aura: faint necromancy
CL: 4
Slot: head
Price: 3,700 gp
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This oversized wooden mask covers the face and extends down to a point at the wearer's waist, covering most of his chest and abdomen. It is simplistically carved as a stylized, bestial face distorted with rage or nightmarish styles. The light wood provides little protection, yet is magically reinforced to grant a +1 [[armor]] bonus. In addition, once per day as a free action, the wearer can cause the mask to warp and contort ferociously, causing a single creature within 15 feet to make a DC 14 Will save or become frightened. This is a mindaffecting fear effect.
