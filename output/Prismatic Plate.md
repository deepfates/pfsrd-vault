Description: This resplendent suit of +3 full plate shimmers and shifts between all the colors of the rainbow. A single color dominates the others at any given time. As a swift action, the wearer can change the dominant color. This color remains dominant until the wearer changes it again. When the wearer of prismatic plate is struck by a prismatic spray, or when he passes through a prismatic sphere or prismatic wall, he ignores the effect that matches the dominant [[armor]] color. He receives no special protection against the other colors of those spells. In addition to this benefit, each color provides a [[unique]] type of protection.
