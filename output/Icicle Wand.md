Name: [[Icicle Wand]]
Aura: faint conjuration [cold]
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 12,250 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This fragile-looking wand appears to be nothing more than a sharpened icicle nearly a foot in length, though it is as sturdy as any wand and the ice never melts. A combination of arcane tool and weapon, icicle wands find frequent use among the winter [[witch]]es of [[Irrisen]], and traders have carried them as far south as the mountains of [[Cheliax]], [[Andoran]], and [[Taldor]]. An icicle wand functions primarily as a wand of ice spears (see page 72), granting its user the ability to create and turn icy terrain against her enemies. In addition, an icicle wand can also be wielded as a masterwork dagger that deals 1 point of cold damage with a successful attack in addition to normal dagger damage. An icicle wand with a caster level of 7th or higher functions as a +1 frost dagger instead.
