Name: [[Scepter Of Shibaxet]]
Aura: overwhelming all
CL: 30
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 4 lbs.
Description: Pazuzu's weapon is the Scepter of Shibaxet, a staff of black metal with a large hook at its tip. The scepter functions as a rod of enemy detection that can be used any number of times per day. If Pazuzu presents the scepter as a standard action, all creatures within 30 feet who view it become panicked for 1d6 rounds unless they succeed at a DC 23 Will save (this is a mind-affecting fear effect). Once per day, Pazuzu can use the Scepter of Shibaxet as a rod of cancellation (this does not deplete or harm the scepter). As a standard action, he can call the scepter to his hand from any distance, even across planar boundaries. As an immediate action, Pazuzu can transform the scepter into a +5 anarchic keen unholy longsword or return it to its normal shape. None of its other [[power]]s can be used in sword form.
