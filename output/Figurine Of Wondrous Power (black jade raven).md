Name: [[Figurine Of Wondrous Power (black jade raven)]]
Aura: moderate conjuration and transmutation
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 9,100 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This fist-sized piece of black jade is exquisitely tooled into the shape of a raven with outstretched wings. Upon command, it transforms into a black raven (use the stats for an eagle) or a giant black raven (use the stats for a giant eagle). Both forms of the raven have [[Improved Steal]] (Advanced Player's Guide) as a bonus feat. The raven understands Common but cannot speak. It can answer questions related to its abilities or what it has seen by cawing once for "yes" and twice for "no." The raven can maintain its non-figurine status for only 24 hours per week. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-hour increments. After three transformations into its giant raven form (though not its smaller version), the statuette loses all magical properties.
