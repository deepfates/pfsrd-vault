Name: [[Embalming Thread]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 7
Slot: item
Price: 10,000 gp
Weight: -
Description: This coarse, acrid-smelling thread is more akin to wire than fabric. When carefully sewn into the body of a flesh golem or zombie (requiring 1 hour per Hit Die of the creature and a successful DC 20 [[Heal]] or Spellcraft check), the stitches change the creature's damage reduction to DR 5/ adamantine and slashing. Variant zombies lacking damage reduction (such as fast zombies) instead gain DR 5/slashing. One length of stitching is required for every Hit Die of the creature being enhanced. Using an insufficient number of lengths has no effect. A full thimble of embalming thread contains 20 lengths. If the skill check to use the stitches fails, they are not wasted, but must first be cleaned and unknotted, requiring 1 hour per stitch. Once used successfully, the stitches cannot be reused.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], gentle repose, stoneskin
