Name: [[[[Wayfinder]] (Standard)]]
Aura: faint evocation
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 500 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: A small magical device patterned off ancient relics of the Azlanti, a wayfinder is typically made from silver and bears gold accents. With a command word, you can use a wayfinder to shine (as the light spell). The wayfinder also acts as a nonmagical (magnetic) compass, granting you a +2 circumstance bonus on Survival checks to avoid becoming lost. All wayfinders include a small indentation designed to hold a single ioun stone. An ioun stone slotted in this manner grants you its normal benefits (as if it were orbiting your head), but frequently reveals entirely new [[power]]s due to the magic of the wayfinder itself (see page 51).
