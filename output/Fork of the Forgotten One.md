Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 20
Slot: item

Weight: 12 lbs.
Description: This +5 flaming wounding unholy ranseur was once the weapon of a [[power]]ful archdevil who they say controlled an entire layer of Hell. When he attempted to defy the Prince of [[Darkness]], he was overthrown and banished into some cold and remote prison at the edge of the multiverse. Still bearing some infernal vestige of the forgotten fiend's [[power]], the fork grants the bearer a +10 bonus on Diplomacy and Intimidate checks and the [[power]] to use scorching ray three times per day. Any nonevil creature who touches the [[Fork of the Forgotten One]] is given a choice: become lawful evil immediately, or die. Those who choose death are instantly slain (Fortitude DC 30 negates). Those who choose to become lawful evil change alignment immediately (no saving throw) and are subject to a demand spell (Will DC 25) requiring that they find the Forgotten One and free him from his icy prison- presumably thereafter he will press them into service for his plans of revenge against those who imprisoned him.
