Name: [[Carpet Of Comfort]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 10
Slot: item
Price: 90,000 gp
Weight: 15 lbs.
Description: This specialized carpet of flying always measures 10 feet by 10 feet. When it's in flight, its passengers are shielded from wind and extreme temperatures as if inside a tiny hut (though without creating an opaque, immobile sphere). In addition, once per day while the carpet of comfort is on the ground, a command word transforms the carpet into an opulent silk tent that, other than its appearance, is equivalent to a secure shelter.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], overland flight, secure shelter, tiny hut
