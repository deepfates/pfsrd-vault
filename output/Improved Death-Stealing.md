name: [[Improved Death-Stealing]]
type: General
description: Your death-stealing gaze creates more [[power]]ful undead.
prerequisites: Nabasu, [[Ability Focus]] (death-stealing gaze)
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: When you would normally create a ghoul with your death-stealing gaze, you instead create a ghast. As a free action, you may also spend a number of growth points in order to even further augment your new undead minion as it is created. If you spend 1 growth point, you create a wight instead of a ghast. If you spend 3 growth points, you create a wraith instead of a ghast. And if you spend 5 growth points, you transform the target into a juju zombie instead of a ghast. Note that spending growth in this manner reduces your statistics as appropriate.
