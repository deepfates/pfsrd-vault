description: [[Animal]]s cannot sense the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures.  [[Animal]]s simply act as though the warded creatures are not there.  If a warded character touches an animal or attacks any creature, even with a spell, the spell ends for all recipients.
