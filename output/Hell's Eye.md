Description: This +1 flaming light mace has an iron shaft and a polished ruby-red stone head, similar to a gemstone. Sometimes a diabolical eye or face is visible for a moment within the stone. The stone is suitable for use as a scrying device for spells such as scrying. Once per day as a swift action, the wielder can transform the mace's flames to hellfire for 1 minute. This hellfire deals half fire damage and half damage from unholy energy. Evil creatures and creatures with the evil subtype take no damage from this unholy energy; good creatures and those with the good subtype take double the usual damage from it.
