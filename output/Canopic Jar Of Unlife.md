Name: [[Canopic Jar]] Of Unlife
Aura: strong conjuration and necromancy
CL: 13
Slot: item
Price: 60,000 gp
Weight: 7 lbs.
Description: This stone jar, capped with the head of an animal or human, resembles one of the traditional carved limestone or pottery canopic jars commonly used to hold the intestines, liver, lungs, and stomach of the deceased in Osirian mummification rites. Unlike normal canopic jars, a canopic jar of unlife is used to preserve the existence of a [[power]]ful undead creature. When a corporeal undead creature is first created, one of its organs must be placed inside the canopic jar of unlife as part of the ritual that transforms the creature into an undead being. Thereafter, the undead creature's existence is linked to the canopic jar of unlife. If the undead creature is destroyed, the canopic jar of unlife disintegrates 2 hours later, and the viscera within the jar start to regenerate into a new undead body for the subject at a rate of 10 hit points per hour. The subject is helpless until restored to full hit points. Once used to regenerate an undead creature, a canopic jar of unlife is destroyed. If the jar is opened manually after viscera are secured in it, the contents disintegrate with an ear-piercing scream and the jar loses all magical [[power]]. [[Smash]]ing the jar (hardness 8, hp 20) also destroys the vessel and the viscera within. A canopic jar of unlife only functions if linked to an undead creature during its creation; existing undead creatures or creatures with phylacteries (such as liches) or with the rejuvenation ability (such as mummy lords) cannot make use of a canopic jar of unlife.
