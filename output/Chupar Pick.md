Name: [[Chupar Pick]]
Aura: moderate evocation and transmutation
CL: 7
Slot: item
Price: 24,304 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: A curved yellow fang juts from the wooden haft of this light pick in place of a metal tip. Though the fang seems fragile, the enchantments on the weapon render it as hard as steel, and the fang evokes some of the [[power]]s of the beast from which it came. A chupar pick functions as a +1 light pick of wounding. When the chupar pick scores a critical hit, its wielder is affected by a haste effect for 7 rounds as if targeted by a haste spell. Subsequent critical hits made while the wielder is affected extend the duration of the haste effect but have no additional effect.
Requirements: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], bleed, haste, one chupacabra fang
