Name: [[Bracers Of Armor +1]]
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 7
Slot: wrists
Price: 1,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: These items appear to be wrist or arm guards, sometimes etched with symbols of protection or depictions of vigilant-looking animals. Bracers of [[armor]] surround the wearer with an invisible but tangible field of force, granting him an [[armor]] bonus of +1 to +8, just as though he were wearing [[armor]]. Both bracers of [[armor]] must be worn for the magic to be effective. Alternatively, bracers of [[armor]] can be enchanted with [[armor]] special abilities. See Table 3-3: Armor Special Abilities for a list of abilities. Special abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of an item, but do not improve AC. Bracers of [[armor]] cannot have a modified bonus ([[armor]] bonus plus [[armor]] special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +8. Bracers of [[armor]] must have at least a +1 [[armor]] bonus to grant an [[armor]] special ability. Bracers of [[armor]] cannot have any [[armor]] special abilities that add a flat gp amount to their cost. Bracers of [[armor]] and ordinary [[armor]] do not stack. If the wearer receives a larger [[armor]] bonus from another source, the bracers of [[armor]] cease functioning and do not grant their [[armor]] bonus or their [[armor]] special abilities. If the bracers of [[armor]] grant a larger [[armor]] bonus, the other source of [[armor]] ceases functioning.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], mage [[armor]], creator's caster level must be at least two times that of the bonus placed on the bracers, plus any requirements of the [[armor]] special abilities
