Name: [[Cartouche Of Distinctive Warding]]
Aura: moderate abjuration
CL: 11
Slot: neck
Price: 24,000 gp
Weight: -
Description: This winged, golden cartouche hangs on a leather thong beaded with semi-precious stones. Normally, a cartouche of distinctive warding functions as a ring of protection +1 and allows the wearer to use shield two times per day. Once per day, the wearer can write the name of a specific individual in Ancient Osiriani hieroglyphs on the cartouche (the name must be the person's true name, not an alias, nickname, or title). This causes the cartouche's regular [[power]]s to go dormant, but for the next hour the wearer is protected against the inscribed individual in three ways: • The wearer gains a +2 deflection bonus to AC against all attacks made by the inscribed individual (including physical attacks, and magic items and spells that require attack rolls). • The wearer gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against spells and effects cast or created by the inscribed individual. • The wearer gains a +2 bonus on opposed skill checks against the inscribed individual. At the end of 1 hour, the inscribed name fades, and the cartouche loses all its [[power]]s for 23 hours. Note that the actions of the inscribed individual's allies (including minions or summoned creatures) are not subject to the cartouche's [[power]].
