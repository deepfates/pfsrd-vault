Name: [[Skull of Ydersius]]
Aura: overwhelming all
CL: 30
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 150 lbs.
Description: The skull of Ydersius is far more than just a [[power]]ful artifact-it is the actual skull of a god. The skull itself is all but indestructible, and while it can observe the [[world]] around it, its capacity to interact with that [[world]] is limited. Ydersius's [[cleric]]s still receive spells from their prayers, granted by this very skull regardless of its location or who might claim the skull as their own-there is no way a mortal can block this effect. Relatively bulky, the skull itself measures nearly 5 feet long. The skull's greatest [[power]] is that it contains a god, and if reunited with the god's missing body, it can restore Ydersius to full potency as a deity. Beyond this staggering [[power]], though, possession of the skull of Ydersius grants several [[power]]ful abilities, as outlined below. • The skull treats the 80-foot-radius area around it as though an unhallow spell had been cast with the skull as the touched point of origin. This effect carries with it two linked spells that affect only worshipers of Ydersius (death ward and freedom of movement), and two linked spells that affect all non-worshipers of Ydersius (dimensional anchor and bane). • Once per day, a creature that touches the skull may cast commune to speak with Ydersius. A non-worshiper of Ydersius who uses this [[power]] must make a DC 25 Will save each time the [[power]] is used to avoid succumbing to a feeblemind spell. • All reptilian creatures (including all worshipers of Ydersius, [[sorcerer]]s with the serpentine or draconic bloodline, and [[druid]]s currently wildshaped into reptilian forms) within 160 feet of the skull of Ydersius gain spell resistance 25 and fast healing 10. Any good-aligned creature that carries the skull of Ydersius, even via an extradimensional space such as a portable hole, gains three negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the skull is carried and disappear when the skull is released. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the skull is carried. A creature that suffers from these negative levels has a 50% spell failure chance on all divine spellcasting attempts.
