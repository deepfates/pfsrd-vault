Name: [[Nether[[world]] Cauldron]]
Aura: strong conjuration
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 1/2 ton
Description: This huge cauldron forged from black iron serves as a dimensional gateway to a mythic nether[[world]] where [[power]]ful entities come seeking to barter with, commune with, or corrupt mythic mortals. To activate the cauldron, a mythic creature must spill some of its own blood into the black basin as an offering of his mythic [[power]]. If the wound deals at least 4 points of damage, the cauldron drains one use of the individual's mythic [[power]] through it. Once activated, the cauldron fills with a strange red fog that remains for 1d20+10 minutes. During this time, mythic creatures can enter the cauldron and be transported to the crossroads. Non-mythic creatures that enter the cauldron take 4d6 points of damage per round until they climb out or die. The nether[[world]] is small, with an overall area of 1 square half-mile. Highly mutable, the nether[[world]]'s appearance is determined by the will of whatever outsider currently waits there. Only one outsider can inhabit the nether[[world]] at any given time. The specifics of what entity resides in the nether[[world]], as well as that entity's desire, change frequently and therefore are left to the discretion of the GM. Time in the nether[[world]] passes out of sync with time in the Material Plane, thus a mythic creature can remain in the nether[[world]] for as long as he wishes, and reemerges from the cauldron only a few minutes after his descent. The nether[[world]] is a crossroads, coterminous with all planes. Outsiders can enter from any plane, but mortals can't travel to other planes from the nether[[world]].
