Name: [[Demon Talon]]
Aura: strong conjuration [evil]
CL: 15
Slot: item
Price: 20,000 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: A demon talon must be held against the raw flesh of a fresh stump-preparing a creature by severing an existing hand causes 1d6 points of Constitution damage, but preparing a preexisting stump by cutting the flesh free at the end causes no significant damage. Once attached, the demon talon fuses with the stump, granting the creature a claw attack as appropriate for a creature one size category larger than the target's actual size. The claw is shaped like a human hand (fingers and a thumb), but looks obviously demonic (scales, strange coloration, long nails, and so on), and is fully capable of wielding weapons or performing any other feat a human hand can perform.
