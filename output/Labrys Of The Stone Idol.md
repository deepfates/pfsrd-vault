Name: [[Labrys Of The Stone Idol]]
Aura: strong evocation
CL: 15
Slot: item
Price: 98,320 gp
Weight: 36 lbs.
Description: This Huge, double-bitted stone axe, or labrys, is carved entirely of hematite, with a wooden shaft covered in fur. It functions as a +3 stone impactUE greataxe that automatically resizes to match the size of its wielder, from Small to Huge size. The hematite that composes the axe is as strong as iron, and doesn't have the fragile quality. Once per day, the labrys of the stone idol can be struck against the ground to create a [[power]]ful tremor, as the earthquake spell. When used in this way, the labrys creates a shield around its wielder, protecting him from the immediate effects of the earthquake, including fissures, falling rubble, and landslides. This shield disappears after 1 round, when the earthquake's effects end.
