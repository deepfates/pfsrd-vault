CL: 7
Slot: item
Price: 15,330 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This +1 shortbow is crafted from one of the long spines that bristle along the body of a sea serpent. When used against a magical beast with the aquatic subtype, a serpentseeker bow gains the benefit of the bane weapon special ability. If such a creature is hit by an arrow fired from this weapon, anyone who touches the bow senses the location of that creature as though by locate creature as long as the arrow remains imbedded in the creature. If the creature is protected by nondetection or a similar effect, anyone holding the bow gains a +10 competence bonus on the caster level check to overcome it, but a failed check means the arrow's magic burns out. The locating magic on an arrow fired from this bow automatically ends after 1d6 days.
Requirements: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], locate creature, summon monster I
