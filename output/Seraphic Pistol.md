Name: [[Seraphic Pistol]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 6
Slot: item
Price: 37,550 gp
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: The gold-washed barrel of this elegant +2 double-barreled pistol always catches the light, and its maple grip feels pleasantly warm to the touch. When its wielder successfully bypasses an evil creature's damage reduction with a single attack, the creature's skin cracks into fissures of golden light. This light negates the creature's DR for the [[gunslinger]] and her allies, fading away after 1 minute.
