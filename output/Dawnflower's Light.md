Name: [[Dawnflower's [[Light]]]]
Aura: faint divination and evocation
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 40,000 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: When lit, this hooded lantern shines brightly in a 60-foot radius, as daylight. Once per day as a swift action, if the owner worships Sarenrae or is a good-aligned divine spellcaster, she can intensify the lantern's light for 1 hour. This intensified light dazzles evil outsiders and undead in the area, and evil incorporeal creatures take 75% damage from magical attacks instead of 50%. If an illuminated creature or object has a mark indicating evil allegiance-such as a demoniac's demonic mark (see page 46 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lords of Chaos, Book of the [[Damned]], Vol. 2)-that mark glow brilliantly, shining through anything short of magical concealments.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], daylight, detect evil, creator must worship Sarenrae
