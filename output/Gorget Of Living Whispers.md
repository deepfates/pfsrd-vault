Description: Once per day as a standard action, the wearer of this collar can speak a suggested course of action. Her words coalesce into a living whisper-a sinuous creature with blue runes lining its back-that appears in a square adjacent to her. The living whisper uses the statistics of a fiendish venomous snake (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 255, 294), but has an Intelligence score of 3 and can communicate telepathically with the gorget's wearer. Instead of being poisoned, any creature bitten by the living whisper must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or be affected by a suggestion spell (CL 9th). This suggestion is determined when the living whisper is summoned and affects all creatures bitten by it. Creatures that can read Aklo can read the runes on the living whisper and know what suggestion is carried by its bite. A living whisper lasts for 1 minute or until slain.
