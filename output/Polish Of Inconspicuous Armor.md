Name: [[Polish Of Inconspicuous Armor]]
Aura: strong conjuration
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 750 gp
Weight: 1/2 lb.
Description: This pungent, tar-black [[armor]] polish comes in a small circular tin. One dose is enough to apply to a single [[Medium]] suit of [[armor]] or two Small suits of [[armor]]. Applying the polish takes 10 minutes, during which time the user must visualize a normal set of clothes or another set of [[armor]]-an alternative appearance for the [[armor]] to take on. After it is applied, the polish's noxious scent dissipates and the [[armor]] appears in the way the user visualized, as the glamered magic [[armor]] special ability. The [[armor]] maintains all properties other than its physical appearance, including weight, [[armor]] check penalty, and maximum Dexterity bonus. This effect remains for 24 hours before wearing off.
