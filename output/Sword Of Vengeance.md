Name: [[Sword Of [[Vengeance]]]]
Aura: moderate evocation [good]
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 32,350 gp
Weight: 8 lbs.
Description: It is [[sai]]d that the empyreal lord Ragathiel's divine soldiers wield these golden +1 holy greatswords in their battles against fiends and other evil creatures. Once per day upon successfully striking an evil-aligned creature with a sword of vengeance, the wielder can cause the sword to emit a 20-foot-radius burst of holy energy. This effect is identical to that of a holy smite spell centered on the creature struck, and deals 4d8 points of damage to each evil creature in the area (or 9d6 points of damage to evil outsiders) and causes each to become blinded for 1 round. A successful DC 16 Will save halves the damage and negates the blinded effect. Neutral creatures in the area only take half damage (reduced to one-quarter on a successful save) and are not blinded.
