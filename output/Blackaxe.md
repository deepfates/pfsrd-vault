Description: [[Blackaxe]] is a Huge +5 plant bane greataxe which is considered epic and can penetrate epic damage reduction. Virulent acid constantly seeps from its blade, dealing +1d6 points of acid damage on a successful hit. On a successful critical hit, [[Blackaxe]] deals an additional +2d10 points of acid damage. Once per minute, the weapon's wielder can use heal on herself by striking a living and nonmagical tree with [[Blackaxe]], causing the tree to wither to ash. The artifact is inexorably tied to the nascent demon lord Treerazer, who can call [[Blackaxe]] to his hand as a free action, despite any intervening distance, so long as [[Blackaxe]] is not kept in an area that prevents teleportation effects from occurring. While [[Blackaxe]] is wielded by another creature, Treerazer always knows that creature's location and condition (as via the discern location and status spells), and by concentrating can observe the [[world]] around the wielder as if using that wielder's senses. While in this state, Treerazer may use any of his spell-like abilities through the link, treating [[Blackaxe]] as if it were the source of the spell-like ability. Each time Treerazer does so, [[Blackaxe]]'s wielder must make a successful DC 25 Will save to avoid being staggered for 1 round from the flow of [[power]]. These spell-like abilities trigger during the wielder's turn in initiative, but do not consume any of the wielder's actions in that round.

[[Destruction]]: In order to destroy [[Blackaxe]], the weapon must be used against a [[power]]ful magical tree, and while the sap on the blade is still fresh it must then be used to sever one of the demon lord Cyth-V'sug's many fungoid limbs. Doing so causes [[Blackaxe]] to explode in a burst of obsidian shrapnel and acid that deals 20d6 points of acid damage and 20d6 points of piercing damage to all within a 60-foot burst (DC 30 Reflex save for half ).
