Name: [[[[Monk]]ey's Paw]]
Aura: strong necromancy and universal
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This dimension-hopping artifact waits patiently until a creature picks it up. Each time it is picked up by a new user, the [[monk]]ey's paw grants that creature three wishes, as if it were a ring of three wishes. Once a new user picks up the [[monk]]ey's paw, it cannot be discarded, not even by way of a wish or a miracle spell. Even if stolen, it reappears among the user's possessions within 1d4 hours. It can only be parted from its bearer when all three of its wishes are used or it is destroyed-but such a feat takes time and patience. When a bearer uses a wish granted by the [[monk]]ey's paw, he is then subject to a curse, as per the spell major curse (DC 25 to remove; Ultimate Magic 215). This curse manifests as the creature taking a -4 penalty to attack rolls, saves, ability checks, and skill checks until the curse is removed. These penalties are cumulative in cases where multiple wishes are used before past curses are removed. Once all three wishes are used, the [[monk]]ey paw plane shifts to a random plane and begins the process anew.
