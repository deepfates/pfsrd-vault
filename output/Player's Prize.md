Description: This tiny copper statue of a featureless, dancing humanoid is sometimes awarded to the winners of contests at Pitax's Academy of Grand Arts. The [[power]] of a player's prize comes not from possessing it, however, but from giving it to an unsuspecting audience member. By inscribing a personal rune on his player's prize, a [[bard]] can cause whoever carries the item (knowingly or not) to be more susceptible to his [[bard]]ic performances. Once inscribed, a player's prize can not be keyed to any other creature. Devious [[bard]]s use Sleight of Hand to drop their player's prize on rivals' or foes' persons, usually in a backpack or in among other gear where it would be difficult to locate. A creature carrying a player's prize keyed to a [[bard]] within 30 feet takes a -2 penalty on Will saves against that [[bard]]'s [[bard]]ic performances, as well as a -2 penalty on opposed skill checks against any skill checks the [[bard]] attempts using his versatile performance class feature. These penalties remain as long as the affected creature continues to carry the player's prize. Once per day as an immediate action, the character whose personal rune is inscribed on the player's prize can speak the item's command word to cause the statue to instantly appear in his hand. The character must be within 30 feet of the player's prize to activate this ability.
