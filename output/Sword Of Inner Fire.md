Name: [[Sword Of Inner Fire]]
Aura: strong transmutation [fire]
CL: 16
Slot: item
Price: 151,315 gp
Weight: 4 lbs.
Description: This +1 flaming burst brilliant energy longsword has a burnished copper hilt and burns with blue and white flame. In the hands of a mythic wielder, the sword's fire damage bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity. As a swift action, the wielder can expend one use of mythic [[power]] to enable the sword of inner fire to damage nonliving creatures (such as constructs and undead) for 1 round, though the sword still can't damage inanimate objects. A wielder of at least 3rd tier can absorb the sword of inner fire into her body as a swift action, and call it back to hand with another swift action. While the sword is stored in this way, her eyes burn with orange flame and she gains a +5 deflection bonus to AC and a +2 luck bonus on all saving throws.
