Name: [[Jawbone Of The Venerable Galevius]]
Aura: overwhelming transmutation
CL: 20
Slot: neck
Price: 0
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This brittle human jawbone is all that remains of the legendary Chelish diplomat Galevius. A simple cord allows the relic to be worn as a necklace. The jawbone represents all of Galevius's substantial [[power]]s of negotiation. The [[power]] of the artifact is not in the jaw, but in the 16 teeth socketed into the bone. Upon donning the jawbone, the wearer understands all of its [[power]]s and limitations. As a standard action, the wearer may remove a tooth from the jawbone and crush it in an open hand to activate its [[power]]s. The jawbone does not function for an evil character; an evil wearer finds the teeth rooted too firmly in the bone to remove. When the Jawbone of the Venerable Galevius is first found, it contains a full set of 16 teeth. When a tooth is removed and crushed by the wearer, it provides the following effect for 1 hour, although an effect immediately ends if the wearer removes the jawbone or crushes another tooth. Incisors (4 teeth): These teeth are used for cutting; in a negotiation, an incisor represents an attack on an opponent's position. Crushing an incisor grants a +4 sacred bonus on Intimidate checks and attack rolls. Canines (2 teeth): Canines are used for tearing; in a negotiation, a canine represents a final, decisive strike in an argument. Crushing a canine grants a +4 sacred bonus on Diplomacy checks. In addition, whenever the user improves a creature's attitude with the Diplomacy skill, the creature's attitude automatically improves by an additional step (but does not exceed helpful). Premolars (4 teeth): Premolars can perform multiple functions; in a negotiation, a premolar represents a careful shift of position. When crushed, a premolar grants a +4 sacred bonus on Bluff checks. In addition, the user does not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving. Molars (6 teeth): These teeth are used for determined grinding; in a negotiation, a molar represents reasoned tenacity and persistence. Crushing a molar provides a +4 sacred bonus on Sense Motive checks and immunity to fatigue and exhaustion. Despite the brittleness of the teeth socketed into the jawbone, the jawbone itself cannot be broken. Once all 16 teeth have been used, the empty jawbone immediately disappears, reappearing elsewhere in the [[world]] where a new owner is likely to encounter it. A prospective owner must be good-aligned and ideally has several ranks in Diplomacy.
