The first is to determine if the reader takes 1 point of permanent Intelligence and Charisma drain. The second is to find out if the reader takes 2 points of permanent Wisdom drain. To destroy the book, it must be burned while remove curse is being cast. If the grimoire is placed with other books, its appearance instantly alters to conform to the look of those other works.
