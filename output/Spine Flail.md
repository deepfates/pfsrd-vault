Name: [[Spine Flail]]
Aura: faint necromancy
CL: 4
Slot: item
Price: 13,308 gp
Weight: 10 lbs.
Description: This weapon looks like the barbed spine of a humanoid. A spine flail functions as a +2 flail that deals slashing damage and has reach. Unlike most weapons with reach, a spine flail can be used against adjacent foes. On a critical hit from a spine flail, the victim must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save to resist being permanently blinded by the blow. Spine flails are favored by [[power]]ful dullahans, who harvest the spines from their first victims. The undead riders have a particular affinity for their personal spine flails, and often maintain a supernatural control over their weapons, causing them to appear or disappear at will.
