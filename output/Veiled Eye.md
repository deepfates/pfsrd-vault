Description: This banded agate attaches itself to its wearer's forehead and then, blinking and [[focus]]ing, begins to act as an additional eye. When worn, the veiled eye has the same vision as the wearer (such as low-light vision, darkvision 60 ft., or the [[oracle]]'s clouded vision curse). It grants the wearer no particular advantages so long as his original eyes continue to function normally. However, should his original eyes stop working, whether because of the wearer becoming blinded or even his own decision to close them, he can see through the veiled eye instead. When the wearer is using the veiled eye as his only vision source, he takes a -2 penalty on ranged attack rolls but gains a +2 insight bonus on saves against gaze attacks.
