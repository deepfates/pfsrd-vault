Name: [[Jalhazar's Wheel]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 7,500 gp
Weight: 15 lbs.
Description: Handles of polished bone and grim skulls decorate this ornately carved ship's wheel. When grasped, the wheel's handles feel comfortably smooth. Those who stand watch at the wheel claim to hear the whispered guidance of Captain Xiribal Jalhazar, and occasionally feel ghostly hands holding the ship's course true. When fitted to the helm of a ship, Jalhazar's wheel grants a +5 competence bonus on [[sai]]ling checks to turn the ship with the hard to port or hard to starboard actions (Skull & [[Shackles]] Player's Guide 13). The wheel also halves the penalty on [[sai]]ling checks made when turning the ship while traveling at three or more times the ship's acceleration. In addition, the ship's pilot can combine a hard to port or hard to starboard action with a full ahead or heave to action as a full-round action up to three times per day.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], animate objects, haste, creator must have 10 ranks in Profession ([[sai]]lor)
