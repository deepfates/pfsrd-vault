CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This large chisel appears to be made of deep purple crystal- it is, in fact, carved from the heart of a single enormous Nahyndrian crystal. Imbued with devastating magic, the Nahyndrian chisel may be used three times per day to target a creature or object with a mage's disjunction. Activating this ability requires the user to make a successful touch attack against the target. A Nahyndrian chisel can be used as an improvised weapon in combat-when so utilized, it has a +3 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, deals 1d4 points of piercing damage on a hit, and automatically bypasses any damage reduction (including DR/epic or DR/-).
