Name: [[Soul Jar]]
Aura: strong necromancy [evil]
CL: 15
Slot: item
Price: 5,000 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: An empty soul jar can be used to contain a soul that has been successfully trapped in a black sapphire gem via soul bind by holding the gemstone against the soul jar's lid for 1 full round. This action transfers the soul in the gem to the soul jar (which can hold the soul of a creature of up to 20 Hit Dice), leaving the black sapphire unharmed and empty of souls 50% of the time. The rest of the time, this transfer of soul from gem to jar shatters the black sapphire. A creature that can use soul bind as a spell-like ability (and thus does not use a [[focus]]) can automatically place a captured soul in a held soul jar as the spell-like ability is used. A soul in a soul jar cannot travel to the Boneyard to be judged, but resurrection or more [[power]]ful magic can restore to life a creature whose soul is caught in a soul jar. A soul jar can only contain one soul at a time. Soul jars are fragile (hardness 1, hp 10); if broken, the soul held within immediately escapes to the Boneyard.
