Name: [[Herbs Of The Primal Beast]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 7
Slot: item
Price: 1,400 gp
Weight: 1/2 lb.
Description: When a humanoid consumes these bitter herbs, they awaken the animal within him, no matter how civilized the consumer believes himself to be. They grant the partaker low-light vision and the scent ability for 1 hour. If the consumer has the rage class feature, he can expend one use of mythic [[power]] as part of entering a rage to take the form of an animal (as beast shape II) while gaining the usual benefits of rage. When the rage ends, any remaining duration of the herbs is lost. A creature without the humanoid type, including a monstrous humanoid, gains no benefits from the herbs. It instead becomes nauseated for 1 round, then sickened for 1d4 rounds. A successful DC 13 Fortitude save leaves the creature sickened for 1 round and negates the nausea.
