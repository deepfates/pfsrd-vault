Name: [[Iron Flask]]
Aura: strong conjuration
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 170,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: These special containers are typically inlaid with runes of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a seal engraved with sigils, glyphs, and special symbols. When the user speaks the command word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container, provided that creature fails a DC 19 Will save. The range of this effect is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature. The command word can be used only once per day. If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the command word, the creature can be forced to serve for 1 hour. If freed without the command word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations. (It usually attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.) Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask a second time provides it a +2 bonus on its saving throw and makes it hostile. A purchased bottle is empty, but a newly discovered bottle might contain any of the following: d% CONTENTS d% CONTENTS 01-50 Empty 89 Demon (glabrezu) 51-54 Large air elemental 90 Demon (succubus) 55-58 Invisible stalker 91 Devil (osyluth) 59-62 Large earth elemental 92 Devil (barbazu) 63-66 Xorn 93 Devil (erinyes) 67-70 Large fire elemental 94 Devil (cornugon) 71-74 Salamander 95 Agathion (avoral) 75-78 Large water elemental 96 Azata (ghaele) 79-82 Xill 97 Archon (trumpet) 83-85 Yeth hound 98 Rakshasa 86 Demon (shadow) 99 Demon (balor) 87 Demon (vrock) 100 Devil (pit fiend) 88 Demon (hezrou)
