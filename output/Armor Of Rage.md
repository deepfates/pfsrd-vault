Name: [[Armor Of [[Rage]]]]
Aura: strong necromancy
CL: 16
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 0
Weight: 50 lbs.
Description: This [[armor]] is similar in appearance to breastplate of command and functions as a +1 breastplate. However, when it is worn, the [[armor]] causes the character to take a -4 penalty to Charisma. All unfriendly characters within 300 feet have a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against her. The effect is not noticeable to the wearer or those affected. In other words, the wearer does not immediately notice that donning the [[armor]] is the cause of her problems, nor do foes understand the reason for the depth of their enmity.
