Name: [[Globe Of Blizzards]]
Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 13
Slot: item
Price: 4,550 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Tiny white crystals hang suspended in a clear fluid inside this fist-sized glass ball, which contains a miniature scene of leafless trees in a snow-covered landscape. Shaking the globe (a move action) activates it, and causes the crystals inside to fly wildly about the globe, taking on the appearance of a mad snowstorm for 1d6 minutes until they settle back down. [[Shatter]]ing an activated globe (hardness 1, hp 2) creates raging blizzard conditions in a 2-mile-radius circle centered on the location where the globe was shattered. In this area, temperatures drop to below freezing, winds blow at over 50 miles per hour, and heavy snow falls (see pages 438-439 of the Core Rulebook). It takes 10 minutes for the blizzard to form, and the conditions last for 1 hour before dissipating, at which point normal weather conditions in the area return. Once shattered, a globe of blizzards is destroyed.
