Name: [[The Shadowstaff]]
Aura: strong conjuration
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This artifact was crafted ages ago, weaving together wispy strands of shadow into a twisted black staff. [[The Shadowstaff]] makes the wielder slightly shadowy and incorporeal, granting him a +4 bonus to AC and on Reflex saves (which stacks with any other bonuses). However, in bright light (such as that of the sun, but not a torch) or in absolute darkness, the wielder takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls, saves, and checks. [[The Shadowstaff]] also has these [[power]]s. • Summon Shadows: Three times per day the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the wielder as if called by a summon monster V spell cast at 20th level. • Summon Nightshade: Once per month, the staff can summon an advanced shadow demon that serves the wielder as if called by a summon monster IX spell cast at 20th level. • Shadow Form: Three times per day the wielder can become a living shadow, with all the movement [[power]]s granted by gaseous form. • Shadow Bolt: Three times per day the staff can project a ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold damage to a single target. The shadow bolt has a range of 100 feet.
