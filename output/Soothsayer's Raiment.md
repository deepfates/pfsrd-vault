Name: [[Soothsayer's Raiment]]
Aura: faint divination
CL: 5
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 10,300 gp
Weight: 40 lbs.
Description: This +1 chainmail is attuned to a particular oracular mystery and contains a revelation associated with that mystery (see the [[oracle]] class description in the Advanced Player's Guide). Its design and coloration are typically suggestive of its related mystery. While wearing the [[armor]], an [[oracle]] has access to that revelation and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. The [[oracle]] must have the appropriate mystery to use the [[armor]]; for example, a soothsayer's raiment (battlecry) is only usable by an [[oracle]] of battle. If the wearer already has that revelation and the revelation grants an ability with a limited number of uses per day, the [[oracle]] can use that ability one additional time per day. This ability has no effect if the [[armor]] is worn by a non-[[oracle]]. For divination spells with a percentage-based chance of success (such as augury and divination), the wearer's chance increases by +5.
Requirements: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], augury, creator must be an [[oracle]] with the desired revelation
