Description: The [[Deck of [[Harrowed]] Tales]] is a [[unique]] Harrow deck linked to the [[Harrowed]] Realm, a fantastical demiplane populated by whimsical and nefarious manifestations of characters from a Harrow deck's illustrations (see the sidebar for more details on this realm). Once per day, at a mental command from its wielder, the [[Deck of [[Harrowed]] Tales]] can create a swirling vortex to the [[Harrowed]] Realm, as per the spell gate. This ability does not function while the deck is in the [[Harrowed]] Realm, requiring those within to find another method of escape. The [[Harrowed]] Realm is detailed in Pathfinder Module: The Harrowing.
