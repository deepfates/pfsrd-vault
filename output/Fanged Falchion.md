Name: [[Fanged Falchion]]
Aura: moderate transmutation [evil]
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 22,375 gp
Weight: 8 lbs.
Description: The blade of this brutal-looking falchion is serrated, forming the fangs of the stylized etching of a jackal's profile on the shimmering metal. Such weapons are fashioned in honor of [[Lamashtu]] and are favored by her most [[power]]ful cultists as weapons not only for battle, but also for sacrifice. A fanged falchion is a +1 unholy falchion and wounds caused by the weapon's serrated edge are horrifically ragged and bleed profusely. Whenever a fanged falchion's wielder scores a successful critical hit with it, the sword's blade animates and "chews" at its victim In addition to doing damage for the critical hit, this horrific chewing deals 2 points of Constitution damage and stuns the victim for 1 round (Fort DC 15 negates). Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to this Constitution damage and the stun effect.
Requirements: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], harm, unholy blight, creator must be evil
