Description: These elegant, dark purple robes are usually decorated with gold stitching suggesting a particular [[sorcerer]] bloodline, though some might indicate a family tree. When a [[sorcerer]] dons a robe of arcane heritage, the stitching pulls itself apart and reweaves to match her particular [[sorcerer]] bloodline. The wearer treats her [[sorcerer]] level as 4 higher than normal for the purpose of determining what bloodline [[power]]s she can use and their effects.
