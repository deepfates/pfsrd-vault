Name: [[Mail Of Malevolence]]
Aura: moderate abjuration
CL: 10
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 61,300 gp
Weight: 40 lbs.
Description: Mail of malevolence hangs in rags and tatters and acts as nonmagical chainmail to wearers who lack at least a moderate evil aura (Core Rulebook 266). When worn by a sufficiently evil character, it instead functions as +2 unrighteous chainmail (see page 123). Mail of malevolence does not bestow a negative level on good wearers. The wearer of mail of malevolence gains SR 21, but only against spells with the good descriptor. In addition, whenever the wearer channels negative energy to harm living creatures, she heals a like amount of damage herself regardless of whether she is living or undead.
