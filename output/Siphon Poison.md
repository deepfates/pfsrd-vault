benefit: As a full-round action, you can remove an injury poison from a helpless or willing creature's bloodstream with a successful [[Heal]] check. The DC of this check is equal to the poison's DC. You can only draw out poison in this way within the first 2 rounds of when the target was poisoned. If the check is successful, the creature no longer suffers any additional effects from the poison. By performing this action, you do not risk poisoning yourself.
