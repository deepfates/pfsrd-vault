name: [[Arcane School Spirit]]
type: General
description: You can talk up the [[power]] of your own school of magic to such an extent that creatures find it more difficult to resist your spells.
prerequisites: Bluff 1 rank, arcane school class feature, gnome.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: As a full-round action, you extol the virtues of your school of magic to one creature within 30 feet. Make a Bluff check opposed by a target's Sense Motive check; if you win the check, the target takes a -2 penalty on saving throws made to resist the next spell of this school that you cast. If your chosen school is universalist, choose a specific school each time you use this ability. If your Bluff check succeeds, however, your lack of true commitment to the school means the target takes only a -1 penalty on its saving throw.
