Name: [[Defoliant Polish]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 800 gp
Weight: -
Description: This container of sickly gray paste can coat the [[armor]] of one [[Medium]] or two Small creatures. Affected objects produce dark gray fumes for the next 24 hours. These fumes cause natural plants to wilt and diminish as soon as they come into contact with the affected [[armor]]. This allows the wearer to move through terrain made difficult due to the presence of vegetation as if it were normal terrain, though the creature leaves a clear path of ruined vegetation. In addition, creatures belonging to the plant type that target someone protected by defoliant polish with a natural attack or grapple take 1 point of damage with each successful attack or each round they maintain the grapple.
