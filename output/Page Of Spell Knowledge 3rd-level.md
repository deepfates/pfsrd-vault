Name: [[Page Of Spell Knowledge 3rd-level]]
Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 17
Slot: item
Price: 9,000 gp
Weight: -
Description: This page is covered in densely-worded arcane or divine magical runes. It contains the knowledge of a single arcane or divine spell (chosen by the creator when the item is crafted). If the bearer is a spontaneous spellcaster and has that spell on her class spell list, she may use her spell slots to cast that spell as if it were one of her spells known. A page of spell knowledge is priced based on the spell's [[cleric]] or [[sorcerer]]/[[wizard]] spell level, unless the spell doesn't appear on either of those spell lists, in which case it is based on the highest spell level as it appears on any other spell list. For example, a spell that is on the 4th-level [[inquisitor]] list and the 2nd-level [[paladin]] list is priced as a 4th-level spell.
