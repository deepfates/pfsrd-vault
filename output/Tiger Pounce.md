type: Combat
description: Your unarmed strikes are as precise as they are [[power]]ful, but they leave you open and you can pursue foes with blinding speed.
prerequisites: [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Power Attack]], [[Tiger Claws]], [[Tiger Style]], base attack bonus +9 or [[monk]] level 8th.
prerequisite_feats: [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Power Attack]], [[Tiger Claws]], [[Tiger Style]]
benefit: While using the [[Tiger Style]] feat, you can apply the penalty from [[Power Attack]] to your AC instead of attack rolls.
