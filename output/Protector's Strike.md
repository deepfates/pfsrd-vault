benefit: When you choose the target of your smite evil ability, you also choose one creature other than you within line of sight. While your smite is in effect, the additional creature you chose gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to your Charisma modifier against attacks made by the target of the smite. This bonus ends when the smite ends. You do not gain the deflection bonus to AC typical for the smite evil class feature.
normal: While smite evil is in effect, the [[paladin]] gains a deflection bonus to her AC equal to her Charisma modifier (if any) against attacks made by the target of the smite.
