Name: [[Fleshhook Of Mythic Sustenance]]
Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 12 lbs.
Description: The fleshhook is an ancient ceremonial artifact used by high priests to serve the sacred feast-meat from their cooking pots. This 4-foot-long wooden pole is wrapped with three metal bands etched with elaborate cygnets and ravens-one band at the base, one in the center, and one shaped into a headpiece that forks into four sharpened tines. When recreating the ancient feasting ritual, which takes 10 minutes, a mythic creature can use the fleshhook to imbue the meat served upon its tines with his own mythic [[power]]. With each piece of meat served, the bearer can transfer one use of mythic [[power]] to the creature that eats the meat. If eaten by a mythic creature, the meat replenishes one use of mythic [[power]]. If eaten by a non-mythic creature, it grants a single use of mythic [[power]] for 24 hours. For as long as that non-mythic creature holds this use of mythic [[power]], it's considered a mythic creature for the purposes of spells and effects, and gains both the hard to kill and surge base mythic abilities. Once that use of mythic [[power]] is spent, the creature loses these abilities and is no longer considered mythic.
