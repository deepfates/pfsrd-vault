Name: [[Ornament Of [[Heal]]ing [[Light]]]]
Aura: faint conjuration
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 10,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This palm-sized holy symbol is composed of tiny pieces of stained glass held in a gold frame. The exact symbol is determined upon the item's creation. As a free action, the creature holding the ornament can project the image of the holy symbol upon any creature or surface within 15 feet, similar to using a shadow puppet and lamp. This light is not bright enough to illuminate an area. If the bearer is a [[paladin]], she may use her lay on hands ability on a creature touched by the symbol's light (effectively increasing her lay on hands range from touch to 15 feet).
