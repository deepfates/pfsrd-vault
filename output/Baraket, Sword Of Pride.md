Name: [[Baraket, Sword Of Pride]]
Aura: strong illusion
CL: 16
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: Although known as the Sword of Pride, in appearances, Baraket is nothing more than an elegant basket hilt seemingly made of glass or highly polished crystal with no blade, as the deadly length of this +5 spell storing speed rapier is invisible. Baraket grants its wielder a +5 bonus on Bluff checks made to feint, so long as his opponent cannot see through invisibility. Additionally, on a critical hit, the sword casts weird upon the target and all of that creature's allies within 30 feet.
