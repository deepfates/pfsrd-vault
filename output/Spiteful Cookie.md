Description: These appealing treats usually come wrapped in wax paper, sealed with a drop of red wax embossed with the face of a smiling child. Made from sugar and bone meal, spiteful cookies can be made in a variety of shapes, such as humanoid creatures, dragons, or other legendary beasts. When the seal is broken and the cookie unwrapped, the creature that unwrapped the cookie must succeed at a DC 12 Will save or be compelled to eat the spiteful cookie. While initially quite tasty, the treat soon turns to ash, cursing the victim to starvation for the next 6 days, as the feast of ashes spell.
