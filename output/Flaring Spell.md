name: [[Flaring Spell]]
type: Metamagic
description: You dazzle creatures when you affect them with a spell that has the fire, light, or electricity descriptor.
prerequisites: 0
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: The electricity, fire, or light effects of the affected spell create a flaring that dazzles creatures that take damage from the spell. A flare spell causes a creature that takes fire or electricity damage from the affected spell to become dazzled for a number of rounds equal to the actual level of the spell. A flaring spell only affects spells with a fire, light, or electricity descriptor. A flaring spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.
