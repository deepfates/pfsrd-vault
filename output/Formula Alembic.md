Name: [[Formula Alembic]]
Aura: faint divination
CL: 3
Slot: item
Price: 200 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This magically-augmented alchemical device distills a potion or [[alchemist]] extract into the knowledge needed to create its formula. By gently heating a potion or extract in the alembic for 1 hour, the device creates a few drops of magical liquid. If consumed by an [[alchemist]], this liquid gives him knowledge of the potion's or extract's formula, as if it were an extract he recorded in his formula book. This knowledge lasts for 24 hours. He may scribe this formula in his formula book in the normal fashion. Using the alembic does not harm the potion, but the process makes it nearly boiling hot (it cools normally). The alembic can only distill the knowledge of formulas on the [[alchemist]] extract list (for example, it cannot turn a potion of a [[cleric]]-only spell into something an [[alchemist]] can learn).
