name: [[Cleave]] Through
type: Combat
description: You are ferocious at hewing smaller opponents.
prerequisites: Str 13, [[Cleave]], [[Power Attack]], base attack bonus +11, dwarf.
prerequisite_feats: [[Cleave]], [[Power Attack]]
benefit: When using [[Cleave]] or Great [[Cleave]], if your initial attack hits, you may take a single 5-foot step as a free action before making your additional attacks. If doing so places a creature within your threatened area, that creature becomes a legal target for your additional [[Cleave]] attack(s) as long as it meets all the other prerequisites.
normal: You may only make additional attacks with [[Cleave]] against creatures you threaten when you make your initial attack.
