The robe of eyes sees all forms of invisible or ethereal creatures or objects within 120 feet. The wearer of a robe of eyes gains a +10 competence bonus on Perception checks. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC even when flat-footed, and can't be flanked. She is not able to avert or close her eyes when confronted by a creature with a gaze attack.
