Name: [[Kinsight Goggles]]
Aura: faint divination
CL: 2
Slot: eyes
Price: 7,500 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Kinsight goggles are in fact two separate crystal monocles, linked together with a simple silver clasp that allows them to both be worn at once like pince-nez spectacles. The left and right halves may be separated and worn individually, allowing two people to see through one another's eyes. When separated, the wearer of either half of the goggles may speak a command word to see through the lens of the other half, so long as the halves of the goggles remain within 500 feet of one another. When the two lenses are attached and worn as one item, they offer no magical benefit-just some minor magnification.
