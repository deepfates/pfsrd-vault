Aura: moderate necromancy
CL: 7
Slot: item
Price: 39,305 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: This +1 unholy scorpion whip (Ultimate Combat 144) is fashioned from skin flayed from a barbed devil's back. It grants its wielder a +5 competence bonus on Intimidate checks. A shaken creature struck by the hellscourge must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or become frightened for 1 round. A frightened or panicked creature struck must instead save or cower for 1d4 rounds. Both of these are mind-affecting fear effects. If wielded by a person who wears hamatula hide [[armor]], the hellscourge functions as a +1 flaming unholy whip. Such a wielder can lash the whip once per day to hurl flames as a scorching ray (creating two rays); doing so extinguishes the whip's flames until the next day.
Requirements: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], fear, scorching ray, unholy blight
