Name: [[Stake Of The Righteous]]
Aura: moderate evocation [good]
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 3,520 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: Cooled in baths of holy water after its forging, this +1 silver stake (see the Advanced Player's Guide) is often used by devout warriors to slay vampires. When driven through a helpless vampire's heart, the stake emits a constant hallow effect centered on the slain vampire (whoever placed the stake can choose to fix a spell effect to the stake as a full-round action; otherwise follow the rules in the hallow spell description in the Core Rulebook). Once a stake of the righteous has been driven into a vampire's heart, only creatures that share the original slayer's alignment can easily remove it. Other creatures may attempt to remove the stake by making a DC 14 Charisma check; a creature that fails this check takes 2d6 points of damage as holy energy courses through the weapon, and it cannot attempt to remove the stake again for 24 hours.
