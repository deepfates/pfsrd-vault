Name: [[Deathlurker's Cloak]]
Aura: faint necromancy
CL: 3
Slot: shoulders
Price: 2,700 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This drab gray cloak billows about as if blown by an invisible wind. Once per day, the wearer can use doom, which causes a deathlike shadow to fleetingly cross the wearer's face. If Groetus is the wearer's patron, once per day the wearer can use false life. If the wearer successfully delivers a coup de grace against a dying foe while false life is active, the wearer's temporary hit points from the false life effect increase by 1 (to a maximum of 20 temporary hit points). The dying creature must have at least as many Hit Dice as the wearer for this effect to occur.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], death knell, doom, false life
