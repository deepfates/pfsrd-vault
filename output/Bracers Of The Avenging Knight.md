Name: [[Bracers Of The Avenging Knight]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 8
Slot: wrists
Price: 11,500 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: These silver bracers are polished to a mirrored sheen, but otherwise shift their appearance to match whatever suit of [[armor]] they are worn with. If the wearer has levels in a class that grants a smite ability (such as a [[paladin]], or a [[cleric]] with the destruction domain), her smite damage is treated as though she were a member of that class four levels higher. If the wearer is not a member of such a class, once per day she may make one smite attack, gaining a bonus on the attack roll equal to her Charisma bonus, and a +5 bonus to the damage roll on a hit.
