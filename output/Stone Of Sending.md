Name: [[Stone Of [[Sending]]]]
Aura: moderate evocation
CL: 8
Slot: item
Price: 16,000 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This paired item is created from a single geode divided into two halves. Any individual who concentrates upon one of the halves can use it to send a mental message to the individual possessing the other half as though she had cast a sending spell. The sender must spend a full round concentrating upon his half of the stone to deliver the message. The message can be longer than for a sending spell, but no longer than 100 words. If the receiving stone is unattended when a message comes through, the gems on its inner surface glow faintly until the geode is touched, releasing the message to its new possessor. If a message comes to an unattended stone that already holds a message, the new message erases and replaces the first message. A stored message lasts for 24 hours before dissipating naturally. Each half of a stone of sending can be used once per day to initiate contact with the other.
