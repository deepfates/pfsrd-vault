Name: [[Hand Wraps Of Blinding Ki]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: hands
Price: 10,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: These fine silk wrappings-covered in mystic symbols and diagrams of the wearer's pressure points-wind around the wearer's hands and wrists. When the wearer spends ki to make an additional attack, he can spend 1 additional point of ki to use the [[Stunning Fist]] feat with the attack, even if he has already used the feat that round. If the wearer is a [[monk]] using an archetype that replaces [[Stunning Fist]] with a different feat that's usable a number times per day equal to his [[monk]] level, hand wraps of blinding ki allow that feat to be used a second time instead of allowing him to use [[Stunning Fist]].
