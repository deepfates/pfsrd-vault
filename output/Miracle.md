description: You don't so much cast a miracle as request one. You state what you would like to have happen and request that your deity (or the [[power]] you pray to for spells) intercede. A miracle can do any of the following things. • Duplicate any [[cleric]] spell of 8th level or lower. • Duplicate any other spell of 7th level or lower. • Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as feeblemind or insanity. • Have any effect whose [[power]] level is in line with the above effects. Alternatively, a [[cleric]] can make a very [[power]]ful request. Casting such a miracle costs the [[cleric]] 25,000 gp in powdered diamond because of the [[power]]ful divine energies involved. Examples of especially [[power]]ful miracles of this sort could include the following: • Swinging the tide of a battle in your favor by raising fallen allies to continue fighting. • Moving you and your allies, with all your and their gear, from one plane to a specific locale through planar barriers with no chance of error. • Protecting a city from an earthquake, volcanic eruption, flood, or other major natural disaster. In any event, a request that is out of line with the deity's (or alignment's) nature is refused. A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 9th-level spell. When a miracle spell duplicates a spell with a material component that costs more than 100 gp, you must provide that component.
