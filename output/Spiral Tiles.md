Description: These 10 ebony, pearl, and ivory tiles, when arranged in a spiral pattern on the ground, provide you with the effects of a guidance spell once per day. The spell's effect lasts until discharged. If your patron is [[Pharasma]], you can toss the spiral tiles upon the ground once per day as a standard action and interpret the patterns they lie in as if you had cast augury. If [[Pharasma]] is not your patron and you attempt to use spiral tiles in this manner, the result is either random or purposefully misleading.
