Religion/God: [[Religious Orders
And Schisms]]
AL: Any
Description: All churches have divergent views within them, if for no other reason than that no two 
people are identical, and thus no two people relate to their deity in exactly the same way. 
Every so often, these divergences grow large enough that most worshipers begin to 
gravitate toward one practice or another, until two distinct traditions begin to form.
