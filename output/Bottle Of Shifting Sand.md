Name: [[Bottle Of Shifting Sand]]
Aura: faint transmutation [earth]
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 750 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This ornate glass bottle is filled with loose sand. A bottle of shifting sand can be thrown as a splash weapon targeting a specific grid intersection (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 202). Treat this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet. If thrown on an earthen or sandy surface, the bottle breaks, creating an area of churning, shifting sand in a 20-foot spread that obliterates tracks and is considered difficult terrain. [[Acrobatic]]s checks in the area take a -5 penalty. Creatures entering or beginning their turn in the affected area must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save each round or become entangled until the beginning of their next turn. If they attempt to move while entangled, they must succeed at a second Reflex save or fall prone. At the end of 5 rounds, the sand disappears, leaving no aftereffects. If a bottle of shifting sand is thrown at a creature, a direct hit instead throws up a cloud of whirling sand that surrounds the creature. This cloud of sand provides concealment to the target and any creatures in adjacent squares for 1 round, but has no effect on the surrounding terrain.
