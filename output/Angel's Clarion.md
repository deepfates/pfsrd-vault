Description: An angel's clarion is a graceful trumpet whose bell unfolds like the petals of a flower. These trumpets are usually platinum or silver near the mouthpiece, transforming to a rose gold at the bell. Three times per day when an angel's clarion is sounded, it releases a blast that sounds like the chiming, resonant voices of an angelic choir. Any good-aligned creatures in a 30-foot cone emanating from the trumpet are washed in positive energy and healed for 3d8+5 points of damage. This energy only affects good-aligned creatures; neutral and evil creatures receive no benefit and undead creatures are not harmed. A carpet of flowers springs up beneath the 30-foot cone, growing and blooming in seconds. Any evil-aligned creatures within the area of effect must succeed at a DC 13 Reflex save or be treated as if in the area of an entangle spell. The entangling flowers persist for 5 minutes.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], cure serious wounds, entangle, creator must worship an empyreal lord
