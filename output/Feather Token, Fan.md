Name: [[Feather Token, Fan]]
Aura: strong conjuration
CL: 12
Slot: item
Price: 200 gp
Weight: -
Description: Each of these items is a small feather that has a [[power]] to suit a special need. The kinds of tokens are described below. Each token is usable once. A particular feather token has no specific features to identify it unless its magic aura is viewed-even tokens with identical [[power]]s can be wildly different in appearance. Fan: A token that forms a huge flapping fan, causing a breeze of sufficient strength to propel one ship (about 25 mph). This wind is not cumulative with existing wind speed. The token can, however, be used to lessen existing winds, creating an area of relative calm or lighter winds (but wave size in a storm is not affected). The fan can be used for up to 8 hours. It does not function on land.
