Name: [[Xill Carapace Armor]]
Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 13
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 83,050 gp
Weight: 15 lbs.
Description: This suit of +1 spiked half-plate [[armor]] is crafted from the hide and carapace of a xill (Bestiary 283) and includes a xill-skull helmet complete with insectlike mandibles, giving the wearer an other[[world]]ly, buglike appearance. Once per day, the wearer can shift from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane and back again, as the etherealness magic [[armor]] special ability. Unlike with standard etherealness [[armor]], however, the transitions to and from planes function exactly like a xill's planewalk ability, save that the wearer cannot take any creatures with it when it s[[witch]]es planes. Additionally, the spikes along the [[armor]]'s back, torso, arms, and upper legs are laced with a natural paralytic. The target of a successful critical hit made with these [[armor]] spikes is paralyzed for 1d4 rounds (Fortitude DC 16 negates).
