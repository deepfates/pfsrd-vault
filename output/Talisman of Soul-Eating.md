Name: [[Talisman of Soul-Eating]]
Aura: faint necromancy
CL: 5
Slot: neck
Price: 5,400 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: Worn on a necklace of vertebrae strung on a thin iron chain, this carved cacodaemon skull still bears dozens of sharp teeth. Once per day as a full-round action, the wearer can use the skull to draw forth the life essence of a dying or recently dead creature, as if the amulet were a living cacodaemon using its soul lock ability (Bestiary 2 64), creating a soul gem that appears in the skull's mouth. The wearer or an evil outsider can ingest the soul gem as a standard action. This frees the soul within the gem, but condemns it to one of the lower planes (though the soul can be raised normally). The ingesting creature gains fast healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to the eater's Hit Dice. Draining a soul with the necklace or consuming a soul gem is an evil act.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], create soul gem
Cost: 2,700 gp.
