prerequisite_feats: 0

goal: Successfully trade your soul to an evil outsider.
completion_benefit: You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to an ability score of your choice. This enhancement bonus can't be dispelled or removed save by the direct intervention of a deity, and counts as a supernatural ability. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus on caster level checks (including dispel checks and checks to bypass spell resistance) against good-aligned outsiders. If you die while under the effects of this agreement, you can't be brought back from the dead unless the evil outsider permits it. You lose your story benefits immediately and permanently if you renege on the arrangement by which you traded your soul, though you keep the feat's basic benefits.
