Name: [[Ampoule Of False Blood]]
Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 15
Slot: neck
Price: 20,000 gp
Weight: -
Description: This necklace consists of a fine gold chain from which hangs a small sealed crystal vial containing preserved liquid blood. Each ampoule is attuned to a specific [[sorcerer]] bloodline. If a [[sorcerer]] (or other creature with [[sorcerer]] bloodline [[power]]s, such as from the [[Eldritch Heritage]] feat in Ultimate Magic) wears the ampoule for at least one day, she loses her existing bloodline [[power]]s and gains the bloodline [[power]]s of the ampoule's bloodline, using her [[sorcerer]] level to determine the [[power]]s gained. The ampoule has no effect on the [[sorcerer]]'s bonus spells, bloodline arcana, or bonus feats from her original bloodline (which remain unchanged). The [[sorcerer]] can only use these bloodline [[power]]s as long as she wears the necklace. Removing the necklace leaves the [[sorcerer]] unable to access any bloodline [[power]], either her own or those of the ampoule, until one hour has passed. As a full round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, the wearer can break open the ampoule and drink the blood within. This destroys the item, and gives her the sickened condition for 1d4 hours. If the drinker is a [[sorcerer]], her bloodline permanently changes to match that of the ampoule. In this case, the [[sorcerer]]'s bonus spells, bloodline arcana, and bloodline [[power]]s all permanently change to match those of the ampoule's bloodline. Bonus feats previously selected due to the [[sorcerer]]'s bloodline are unaffected, but new feats must be selected from the new bloodline's bonus feat list.
Requirements: Craft Wondrous item, limited wish, polymorph, creator must be a [[sorcerer]] of the appropriate bloodline
