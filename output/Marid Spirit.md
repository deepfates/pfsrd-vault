name: [[Marid Spirit]]
type: Combat
description: You can manipulate cold energy to protect yourself and freeze your foes.
prerequisites: Con 15, Wis 15, [[Elemental Fist]]**, [[Marid Style]], [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], base attack bonus +11 or [[monk]] level 9th.
prerequisite_feats: [[Elemental Fist]], [[Marid Style]], [[Improved Unarmed Strike]]
benefit: You gain one additional [[Elemental Fist]] (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempt per day. While using [[Marid Style]], you gain cold resistance equal to your base attack bonus, or [[monk]] level plus base attack bonus gained from levels in classes other than [[monk]], whichever is higher. While denied your Dexterity bonus to AC you are also denied this resistance. Creatures that take cold damage from your [[Elemental Fist]] attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modif ier) or become entangled in ice for 1d4 rounds. The ice has hit points equal to three times your base attack bonus or [[monk]] level, whichever is higher, and a break DC of 15 + your base attack bonus or [[monk]] level, whichever is higher. Destroying or breaking the ice ends the entangled condition.
