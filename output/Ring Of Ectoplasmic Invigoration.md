Name: [[Ring Of Ectoplasmic Invigoration]]
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 6
Slot: ring
Price: 12,000 gp
Weight: -
Description: A [[summoner]] wearing a ring of ectoplasmic invigoration can use his maker's call class feature to absorb his [[eidolon]] (dismissing it in the process) instead of bringing it to his side. He gains 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die of the [[eidolon]] and the benefits of a lesser restoration spell. The [[eidolon]] must still be within range of his maker's call ability. Any temporary hit points gained fade after 1 hour or when the [[eidolon]] is summoned again. A wearer with the transposition ability can transport himself to the [[eidolon]]'s square (still absorbing and dismissing it) rather than calling the [[eidolon]] to him.
Requirements: [[Forge Ring]], the creator must be able to summon an [[eidolon]] and have the maker's call class feature
