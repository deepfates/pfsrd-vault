Name: [[Rod Of Arson]]
Aura: strong evocation
CL: 12
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: All tests indicate that this hollow metal tube is a rod of flame extinguishing until its owner uses it to extinguish or suppress a fire in a combat or other dangerous situation. Once she does, she discovers that rather than quenching the flame, the rod causes the flame to enter her body. This flame persists inside of her for the next 24 hours, causing minor discomfort and giving her the sickened condition, but causing no visible injury. However, when the wielder is adjacent to or within a flammable object or structure, she feels inclined to set the object ablaze, using any means at her disposal. Each round the wielder resists this urge, she takes 1d6 points of fire damage as the flame within her surges and roils. After 1 minute of this, she must make a DC 15 Will save or succumb to the temptation; if she saves, the urge passes, the internal fire stops harming her, and she can interact normally with the flammable target thereafter. Once the curse reveals itself, the owner must make a DC 15 Will saving throw to avoid using the item to try and extinguish or suppress any fire she encounters which she herself did not start. She cannot use the rod against fires that she personally started. Successful curse-breaking magic allows the wielder to get rid of the rod and harmlessly dissipates any fire persisting inside her from the action of the rod.
