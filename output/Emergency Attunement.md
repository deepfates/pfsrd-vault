name: [[Emergency Attunement]]
type: General
description: You can adapt your defenses to any situation.
prerequisites: Spellcraft 7 ranks.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: As a standard action, you can alter one of your ongoing abjuration or transmutation spells. It must be currently affecting you and must grant a choice of options when cast. You change its benefit to a different one from the same list. In order to accomplish this, you must make a successful Spellcraft check (DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell to be altered). The duration of the spell is reduced to half of the spell's remaining duration. For example, a 7thlevel [[wizard]] could change her resist energy ( fire) spell with 50 minutes of its duration remaining into resist energy (cold), but the new duration would be 25 minutes. This ability does not change the benefit for any other creatures targeted by the original spell.
