description: This spell enables you to change all metal objects within its area to wood. Weapons, [[armor]], and other metal objects carried by creatures are affected as well. A magic object made of metal effectively has spell resistance equal to 20 + its caster level against this spell. Artifacts cannot be transmuted. Weapons converted from metal to wood take a -2 penalty on attack and damage rolls.  The [[armor]] bonus of any [[armor]] converted from metal to wood is reduced by 2. Weapons changed by this spell splinter and break on any natural attack roll of 1 or 2, and [[armor]] changed by this spell loses an additional point of [[armor]] bonus every time it is struck with a natural attack roll of 19 or 20.  Only limited wish, miracle, wish, or similar magic can restore a transmuted object to its metallic state.
