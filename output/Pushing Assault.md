name: [[Pushing Assault]]
type: Combat
description: A strike made with a two-handed weapon can push a similar sized opponent backward.
prerequisites: Str 15, [[Power Attack]], base attack bonus +1.
prerequisite_feats: [[Power Attack]]
benefit: When you hit a creature your size or smaller with a two-handed weapon attack modif ied by the [[Power Attack]] feat, you can choose to push the target 5 feet directly away from you instead of dealing the extra damage from [[Power Attack]]. If you score a critical hit, you can instead push the target 10 feet directly away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunities, and the target must end this move in a safe space it can stand in. You choose which effect to apply after the attack roll has been made, but before the damage is rolled.
