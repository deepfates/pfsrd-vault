description: You place a drop of your blood on a weapon and charge it with magic so that you transfer a small amount of your life essence to the next creature you strike with the weapon. Thereafter, you may spend a move action to know the direction and general distance of that creature. You must strike a creature within 1 minute of casting this spell or the magic is wasted.  The Red Mantis Assassins created this spell, though other thieves' and assassins' guilds have similar spells. Note that this spell is on the Red Mantis Assassin prestige class spell list, not something anyone can cast by being a member of the Red Mantis Assassins faction.
