Name: [[Black Iron Axe]]
Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 12 lbs.
Description: When a mythic creature uses this +6 keen vorpal greataxe forged from a dull black alloy to decapitate his foes, the axe's head glows with dozens of mysterious runes. The wielder of a black iron axe can claim any heads he decapitates with the artifact, and use them as batteries for mythic [[power]]. The axe's wielder can place a single use of mythic [[power]] into the head as a full-round action for later use. A decapitated head rots and become useless in 1d6 days. Only the creature that placed the use of mythic [[power]] in a head can use the [[power]] stored within it, and she must be in physical contact with the head to do so. Each head weighs 10 pounds.
