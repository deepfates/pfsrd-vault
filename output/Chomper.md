Aura: strong conjuration
CL: 17
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 15 lbs.
Description: Most bags of devouring appear to be normal sacks, but [[Chomper]] is unlike most bags of devouring. Sporting rows of vicious teeth, a bad attitude, and a thirst to devour all things, this intelligent cursed item believes that it is the favored maw and most important appendage of a creature it mysteriously refers to as the Eater of All. [[Chomper]] hates all creatures except for demons, whom it considers kindred [[spirits]] of destruction. [[Chomper]] has all of the magical abilities of a regular bag of devouring, along with the following additional [[power]]s. • As a standard action, [[Chomper]]'s possessor can swing the bag by its straps in an attempt to strike any single creature or unattended item within a 5-foot radius. [[Chomper]] (not the wielder) can then make a single bite attack against the target. This bite has a +14 attack bonus and deals 1d10+5 points of damage plus 2 points of bleed damage. This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Attacks made in this way are never modified by the wielder's abilities. • When a non-demon is in possession of [[Chomper]], the bag's cursed aura imparts a -1 penalty on all of its wielder's attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If [[Chomper]] manages to gain dominance over a non-demon wielder through a personality conflict, it directs its bearer to seek out victims to feed to it.
