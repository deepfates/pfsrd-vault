Description: On command, this ring gives its wearer the ability to see into and through solid matter. [[Vision]] range is 20 feet, with the viewer seeing as if he were looking at something in normal light even if there is no illumination. X-ray vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead blocks the vision. Using the ring is exhausting, causing the wearer 1 point of Constitution damage per minute after the first 10 minutes of use in a single day. The ring must be used in 1-minute increments.
