name: Turn [[Undead]]
type: General
description: Calling upon higher [[power]]s, you cause undead to flee from the might of your unleashed divine energy.
prerequisites: Channel positive energy class feature.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: You can, as a standard action, use one of your uses of channel positive energy to cause all undead within 30 feet of you to flee, as if panicked. [[Undead]] receive a Will save to negate the effect. The DC for this Will save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your [[cleric]] level + your Charisma modifier. [[Undead]] that fail their save flee for 1 minute. Intelligent undead receive a new saving throw each round to end the effect. If you use channel energy in this way, it has no other effect (it does not heal or harm nearby creatures).
