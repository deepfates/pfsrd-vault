Name: [[Sash Of Flowing Water]]
Aura: moderate abjuration
CL: 10
Slot: belt
Price: 25,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: If this belt's wearer has at least one hand free (holding nothing), he can attempt to deflect a successful melee attack with an immediate action. To do so, he rolls an unarmed strike against the opponent, including any applicable modifiers such as a favored enemy bonus or the penalty for [[Power Attack]]. If his attack roll is greater than the opponent's attack roll, the attack is negated without effect. The unarmed strike itself causes no damage and does not count as a successful attack against the opponent. The opponent does not need to be within the wearer's reach to use this ability. Whether the attack succeeds or not, the wearer takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls until the end of his next turn.
