Name: [[Unguent of Timelessness]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 3
Slot: item
Price: 150 gp
Weight: -
Description: When applied to any matter that was once alive, such as wood, paper, or a dead body, this ointment allows that substance to resist the passage of time. Each year of actual time affects the substance as if only a day had passed. The coated object gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. The unguent never wears off, although it can be magically removed (by dispelling the effect, for instance). One flask contains enough material to coat eight [[Medium]] or smaller objects. A Large object counts as two [[Medium]] objects, and a Huge object counts as four [[Medium]] objects.
