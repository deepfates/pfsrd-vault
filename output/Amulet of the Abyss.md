Description: Each amulet of the Abyss bears a demon lord's rune on its face, indicating the lord to which the amulet is attuned. An amulet of the Abyss functions as an unholy symbol to the demon lord. For a worshiper of that demon lord, an amulet of the Abyss functions as a phylactery of faithfulness. An amulet of the Abyss grants its wearer the ability to cast all three spell-like abilities granted by the associated demon lord's first demonic boon, once per day per spell. See the individual demon lord entries in Chapter One for lists of the spells each demon lord grants as a boon. Any lawful or good character who wears this amulet gains two negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the amulet is worn. Although they never result in actual level loss, they cannot be overcome in any way as long as the amulet is worn.
