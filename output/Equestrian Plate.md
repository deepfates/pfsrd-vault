Name: [[Equestrian Plate]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 9
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 10,650 gp
Weight: varies
Description: Shined to a mirror finish, this suit of +2 full plate is decorated with gold inlay. As a move action when the wearer is mounted, the plates of the [[armor]] expand and reposition to protect the wearer's mount. In this form, the [[armor]] becomes a suit of +2 banded mail for the wearer and a suit of +1 banded mail [[bard]]ing worn by the mount. A second move action merges it back into +2 full plate. Equestrian plate cannot transform and protect a mount more than one size larger than its wearer or a creature that cannot wear [[bard]]ing. It can create exotic [[bard]]ing, however, such as for a griffon or dragon. If extra enhancements or spells are placed upon equestrian plate in full plate form, they affect only the wearer's [[armor]] when the suit is split. Effects on the [[bard]]ing are suppressed when it is merged into the [[armor]]. If either suit of [[armor]] is broken while separated, the other half immediately gains the broken condition as well. Destroying one suit destroys the other as well. Full plate 50 lbs. Banded mail 35 lbs. [[Bard]]ing 70 lbs.
