Description: Winding this music box causes it to play a haunting, 30-second-long melody. However, a [[bard]] can learn this tune as though it were a masterpiece (Ultimate Magic 21). When performed by a [[bard]], the tune becomes the Song of Extinction masterpiece (see below). Once per week, as a standard action, the wielder can command the music box to perform the Song of Extinction masterpiece itself, affecting all within range except the bearer. After being used in this way, the music box cannot be reactivated in any way for 1 week.
