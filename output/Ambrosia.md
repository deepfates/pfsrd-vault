CL: 18
Slot: item

Description: This divine food comes in many forms, from a light and airy honeyed cake to a deep, rich chocolate. A mythic creature that eats this food is restored and replenished. Eating this food takes 1 minute, and when the meal is done, the consumer regains all her uses of mythic [[power]] for the day. If a non-mythic creature consumes ambrosia, that creature is subject to neutralize poison, remove curse, and remove disease, each at caster level 10th. A mythic creature can choose to either gain this effect instead of regaining mythic [[power]].
