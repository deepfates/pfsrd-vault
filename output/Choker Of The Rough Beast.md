Name: [[Choker Of The Rough Beast]]
Aura: strong abjuration and conjuration
CL: 20
Slot: neck
Price: 100,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This black iron neckpiece is forged in the likeness of [[Rovagug]]'s holy symbol. An evil wearer gains a +2 profane bonus on all saving throws. A creature with the touch [[of corruption]] class ability that wears the choker of the Rough Beast increases the damage dice of that ability from 1d6 per 2 [[anti[[paladin]]]]APG levels to 1d8 per 2 levels. Good-aligned creatures within 120 feet of the choker of the Rough Beast hear distant bellows of unimaginable rage, giving them a -2 penalty on all Perception checks as the sounds distract them. Within 30 feet of the necklace, the sound increases, and all good-aligned creatures must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or be shaken while within range. They can attempt another save after 24 hours. If the wearer willingly breaks the choker in half (a fullround action), the ground under his feet ruptures open and consumes him (as the imprisonment spell). The blood of [[Rovagug]] seeps up from the wound in the earth 1d6 rounds after the wielder is consumed. Treat this as a fiendish carnivorous blob (Bestiary 2 51, 292) that attacks any living creature within sight. The hole seals immediately after the blood rises.
