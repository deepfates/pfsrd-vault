Name: [[Captain's Locker]]
Aura: strong conjuration
CL: 13
Slot: item
Price: 30,000 gp
Weight: 150 lbs.
Description: This iron-banded sea chest is 2-1/2 feet by 3 feet by 4 feet in size and is decorated with chains and brass skulls. The chest has no lock, but any standard lock can be easily attached to its hasp. The interior of a captain's locker functions similarly to a type IV bag of holding, and can hold up to 2,500 pounds or a volume of 250 cubic feet. The chest's weight remains the same, regardless of what it is holding. A captain's locker does not rot or take any other damage from immersion in water and is watertight, even if opened underwater. When a captain's locker is placed within the hold of a ship or some other enclosed cargo-carrying vehicle (such as a freight wagon with a cargo box), the chest warps the dimensions of the cargo hold so that the area's cargo capacity increases by 50% without changing the weight of the vehicle. The cargo area remains attached to the vehicle, however, so outside conditions that affect the vehicle can also affect the cargo hold. If the captain's locker is removed from the cargo area while the hold contains more cargo than it could contain on its own, any excess cargo is forcibly expelled through hatches or other means of egress, dealing 3d6 points of damage to anyone standing within 5 feet of the means of egress.
