name: [[Archon Style]]
type: Combat
description: You have trained thoroughly to protect your allies from harm, even if it means temporarily sacrificing your own safety in the process.
prerequisites: Combat [[Expert]]ise, [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], base attack bonus +2 or [[monk]] level 2nd.
prerequisite_feats: Combat [[Expert]]ise, [[Improved Unarmed Strike]]
benefit: While using this style, as a standard action, you can actively protect adjacent allies from a single opponent that you are currently adjacent to. This grants any adjacent allies a +2 dodge bonus to AC against that opponent's next melee attack (as long as that attack comes before the beginning of your next turn), but causes you to take a -2 penalty to AC against that opponent until your next turn. The dodge bonus persists even if your allies move away from you, but still only applies against attacks made by the opponent that you designated upon first using this ability.
