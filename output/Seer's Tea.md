Description: This rich tea can be made from any number of herbs. When the tea is brewed without a filter and imbibed, the drinker can read the patterns in the leaves remaining at the bottom of her cup, gaining the benefits of an augury spell. Additionally, the unbrewed tea can be used as an extra material component when casting augury, removing the need for a [[focus]]. In this case, the caster instead reveals information as if she had cast divination instead.
