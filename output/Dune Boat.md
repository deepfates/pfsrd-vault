Description: Fashioned from bound reeds in traditional Osirian style, a dune boat is a wondrous variant of the more common folding boat. Like that item, a dune boat appears as a wooden box about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep when inactive, save that each surface is emblazoned with Ancient Osiriani hieroglyphs. A dune boat functions identically to a folding boat, save that it can move across sandy terrain as if it were moving across water. In boat form, it can hold 6 people comfortably, while the ship form carries 20 with ease.
