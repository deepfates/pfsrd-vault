Name: [[Tunnel Defender Stoneplate]]
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 9
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 26,700 gp
Weight: 75 lbs.
Description: Even bulkier than its nonmagical cousins, this set of +3 stoneplateUE is crafted from stones of widely differing colors, and is often allocated to Ninth Battalion soldiers assigned to the deepest and most dangerous of the [[Darklands]]' tunnels. Once per day, the wearer can call forth a wall of stone that fills up to nine contiguous 5-foot squares. Unlike with the standard spell, the wall must be a straight line, and the wielder must choose to occupy one 5-foot section of the wall, as the [[armor]] merges with the wall around it. While the wall of stone is in effect, the wearer gains a +2 circumstance bonus to AC, but can move only within the wall. The wearer can dismiss the wall as a standard action; otherwise, it dissipates in 10 rounds. As a full-round action, the wielder can make the wall permanent by allowing himself to be consumed by the stone. In this case, the wearer can be restored to life only by a miracle or wish.
