Description: This silver coin bears the symbol of the Prophecies of Kalistrade on one side, and its other side is inscribed with one of the many rules that lead to enlightenment. When the coin is placed in a non-magical bag or purse and the command word is spoken, the coin reduces the weight of any coins, gems, or jewelry carried in the bag by half. In addition, the container becomes the [[focus]] of an alarm spell that's triggered if the container is opened without the command word being spoken. Most Kalistocrat's coins have a mental alarm. The coin doesn't function for containers of other materials, and a container can benefit from only one Kalistocrat's coin at a time.
