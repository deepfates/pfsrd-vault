Aura: strong abjuration
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This +5 large shield, emblazoned with the symbol of the sun, allows the wielder to cast spells as if she were a 20th-level [[paladin]] with a Charisma of 20. The spells gained are cumulative with any existing spells per day the character might have, even from [[paladin]] class levels. [[The [[Shield]] of the Sun]] also grants its wielder spell resistance 15. It absorbs the first 10 points of damage from any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). In return for all this, once per year the shield's owner must undertake a quest at the behest of a lawful good deity (no saving throw to avoid). A chaotic or evil character gains four negative levels when wielding the [[Shield]] of the Sun. The negative levels persist as long as the shield is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells). The negative levels disappear when the shield is stowed or leaves the wearer's possession.
