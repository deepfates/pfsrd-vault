Once per day, the wielder can utter a command word to create one of the following effects: vortex (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 254) or control weather. If the wielder uses a polymorph or supernatural effect to take the shape of a creature with a natural bite attack, the trident of the storm captain vanishes and the wielder's bite attack gains a +4 enhancement bonus until the shapechanging effect ends and the trident reappears. The wielder cannot use the trident's other abilities while shapechanged.
