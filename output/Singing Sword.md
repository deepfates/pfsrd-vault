Name: [[Singing Sword]]
Aura: strong enchantment
CL: 14
Slot: item
Price: 165,315 gp
Weight: 4 lbs.
Description: This +2 keen dancing longsword is infused with the soul of a [[bard]] who chose to instill his [[consciousness]] into a weapon rather than to see his voice die. The sword constantly sings. The only way to silence it to a whisper is with a DC 15 Diplomacy or Intimidate check, and even this only quiets the sword for 10 minutes plus another 10 minutes for every 5 points by which the DC is exceeded. The sword speaks, though it typically communicates through song. A singing sword has the following [[power]]s. • Eight times per day, a singing sword can use [[bard]]ic performance, but can only use the countersong, distraction, fascinate, inspire courage, or inspire competence abilities. The sword is treated as an 8th-level [[bard]] for the purposes of these abilities. • Three times per day, the singing sword can use the heroic finale spell (Advance Player's Guide).
Requirements: Craft Arms and Armor, keen edge, animate object, the soul of a willing [[bard]] of at least 8th level
