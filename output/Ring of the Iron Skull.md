Description: Crudely cut amethysts and a single engraved skull decorate the band of this thick iron ring. The ring grants its wearer a +5 competence bonus on Appraise checks to determine the most valuable item in a treasure hoard and a +5 competence bonus on [[Heal]] checks to ascertain details of a dead creature's demise. Once per day as a standard action, the wearer can touch the ring to a corpse or piece of a corpse to learn the dead creature's name, gender, race, and profession or role, as well as the manner of the creature's death. The wearer also becomes aware of the location of other pieces of the corpse if they're within 1,200 feet. If the body part comes from a creature that's still alive or undead, the wearer gains no information. The ring of the iron skull must be worn for 24 hours before it starts to function for the wearer.
