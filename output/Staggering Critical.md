name: [[Staggering Critical]]
type: Combat
description: Your critical hits cause opponents to slow down.
prerequisites: [[Critical Focus]], base attack bonus +13.
prerequisite_feats: [[Critical Focus]]
benefit: Whenever you score a critical hit, your opponent becomes staggered for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful Fortitude save reduces the duration to 1 round. The DC of this Fortitude save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. The effects of this feat do not stack. Additional hits instead add to the duration.
