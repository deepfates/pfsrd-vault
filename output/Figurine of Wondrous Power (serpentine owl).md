Name: [[Figurine of Wondrous Power (serpentine owl)]]
Aura: Moderate transmutation
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 9,100 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Each of the several kinds of figurines of wondrous [[power]] appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak. If a figurine of wondrous [[power]] is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its [[power]] departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. Serpentine Owl: This figurine becomes either a normal-sized horned owl or a giant owl (use the stats for the giant eagle) according to the command word used. The transformation can take place once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous hours. However, after three transformations into giant owl form, the statuette loses all its magical properties. The owl communicates with its owner by telepathic means, informing her of all it sees and hears.
