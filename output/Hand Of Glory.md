Name: [[Hand Of Glory]]
Aura: faint varied
CL: 5
Slot: neck
Price: 8,000 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This mummified human hand hangs around a character's neck by a leather cord (taking up space as a magic necklace would). If a magic ring is placed on one of the fingers of the hand, the wearer benefits from the ring as if wearing it herself, and it does not count against her two-ring limit. The hand can wear only one ring at a time. Even without a ring, the hand itself allows its wearer to use daylight and see invisibility each once per day.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], animate dead, daylight, see invisibility
Cost: 4,000 gp
