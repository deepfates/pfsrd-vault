Name: [[Bracers Of Sworn [[Vengeance]]]]
Aura: strong evocation
CL: 15
Slot: wrists
Price: 25,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: These white leather bracers have delicate elven runes etched upon them, one reading "swift defeat" and the other "vengeance." Once per day, as an immediate action when the wearer takes hit point damage from a target, he may cry out, "Death to those who wrong me!", swearing vengeance against the attacker. The wearer gains a +1 competence bonus on weapon attack rolls made against the target of his sworn vengeance, and deals an additional 2d6 points of damage on successful weapon attack rolls. For the duration of the effect, the wearer takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls against any target other than his sworn enemy. These bonuses and penalties last for 24 hours or until the sworn enemy is slain or destroyed by the wearer, whichever comes first. If the wearer fails to slay the target of his oath, these bracers cannot be used again until 7 days have passed.
