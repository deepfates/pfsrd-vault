Name: [[Figurine of Wondrous Power (onyx dog)]]
Aura: Moderate transmutation
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 15,500 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Each of the several kinds of figurines of wondrous [[power]] appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak. If a figurine of wondrous [[power]] is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its [[power]] departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. Onyx Dog: When commanded, this statuette changes into a creature with the same properties as a riding dog except that it is endowed with an Intelligence of 8, can communicate in Common, and has exceptional olfactory and visual abilities. It has the scent ability and adds +4 on its Perception checks. It has 60- foot darkvision, and it can see invisibility. An onyx dog can be used once per week for up to 6 hours. It obeys only its owner.
