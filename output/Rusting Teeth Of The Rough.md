Name: [[Rusting Teeth Of The Rough]]
Aura: faint necromancy
CL: 3
Slot: item
Price: 8,320 gp
Weight: 12 lbs.
Description: This +1 greataxe has a corroded edge that constantly sheds metal shards and rusty powder, though the blade never gets any smaller and this doesn't weaken the weapon in any way. Whenever the axe damages a creature, the target must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save or a shard from the weapon lodges in the creature's flesh; the target is sickened until the shard is removed. Removing a shard deals 1d4+1 points of damage to the target, unless whoever is removing the shard succeeds at a DC 15 [[Heal]] check as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional shard is removed. A rusting grasp spell immediately destroys all shards embedded in the target.
