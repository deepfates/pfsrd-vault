Name: [[Catskin Leather]]
Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 13
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 18,910 gp
Weight: 15 lbs.
Description: Rather than the hide of a cat, this extremely supple suit of jet-black +1 shadow leather [[armor]] grants a portion of the grace and fortune of a feline. It has no [[armor]] check penalty or maximum Dexterity bonus. The wearer receives a +5 competence bonus on [[Acrobatic]]s checks and takes only half normal damage from falling. When the wearer's hit points would be reduced to a negative amount equal to her Constitution score from an attack or spell, the [[armor]] falls to pieces and is destroyed, and the wearer takes only half damage from the attack or spell.
Requirements: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], cat's grace, feather fall, and limited wish, wish, or miracle
