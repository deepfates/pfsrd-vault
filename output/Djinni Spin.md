name: [[Djinni Spin]]
type: Combat
description: You can surround yourself with the [[power]] of the storm, spinning like a hurricane to unleash a violent blast of electrical energy.
prerequisites: Con 15, Wis 17, [[Djinni Style]], [[Djinni Spirit]], [[Elemental Fist]]**, [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], base attack bonus +13 or [[monk]] level 11th.
prerequisite_feats: [[Djinni Style]], [[Djinni Spirit]], [[Elemental Fist]], [[Improved Unarmed Strike]]
benefit: While using [[Djinni Style]], as a standard action you can spend two [[Elemental Fist]] (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempts to surround yourself with a whirlwind of electrified air. Creatures adjacent to you take your unarmed strike damage plus the electricity damage from your [[Elemental Fist]] and are deafened for 1d4 rounds. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being deafened.
