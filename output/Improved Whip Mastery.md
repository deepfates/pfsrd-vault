name: [[Improved [[Whip Mastery]]]]
type: Combat
description: You are able to entangle opponents with the coils of your whip.
prerequisites: [[Weapon Focus]] (whip), [[Whip Mastery]], base attack bonus +5.
prerequisite_feats: [[Weapon Focus]] (whip), [[Whip Mastery]]
benefit: While wielding a whip, you threaten the area of your natural reach plus 5 feet. You can also use a whip to grasp an unattended Small or Tiny object within your whip's reach and pull that object into your square. To do so, you must hit AC 10 with a melee touch attack. Further, you can use the whip to grasp onto an object within your whip's reach, using 5 feet of your whip as if it were a grappling hook, allowing you to use the rest of your whip to swing on like a rope. As a free action, you can release the object your whip is grasping, but you cannot use the whip to attack while the whip is grasping an object.
