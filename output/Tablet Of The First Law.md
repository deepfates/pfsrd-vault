Description: This book-sized stone tablet is a recreation of the famous Laws of Man from the nation of [[Rahadoum]]. The tablet lists the anti-religious teachings of the First Law, along with several related verses that have been transcribed along the edges. When the tablet is read-a process that takes 10 minutes-its text glows with a golden light, providing the illumination of a candle, and the reader gains a +1 bonus on Will saving throws against all effects that come from a divine source for 24 hours. Only one person can benefit from this bonus at a time. A reader who possesses the [[Godless [[Heal]]ing]] feat (The Inner Sea World Guide 287) can use the healing granted by that feat while reading the tablet. In this case, at the completion of the reading, the reader rolls twice and chooses the better roll when determining the amount of healing granted by [[Godless [[Heal]]ing]].
