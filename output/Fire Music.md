name: [[Fire Music]]
type: Mythic
description: You masterfully weave the ancient melodies of fire into your spells.
prerequisites: [[Fire Music]]UM.
prerequisite_feats: [[Fire Music]]
benefit: When you use [[Fire Music]] to change any of the damage dealt by a [[bard]] spell to fire damage, that damage ignores fire resistance up to your tier. If you cast summon monster as a [[bard]] spell and choose to give the summoned creature a fiery appearance, increase its fire resistance by 5 (adding to the resistance already granted by [[Fire Music]]) and add 1d4 points of fire damage to all of its natural attacks instead of the +1 fire damage normally granted by [[Fire Music]]. Creatures with the fire subtype also gain these benefits.
