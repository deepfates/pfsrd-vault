Name: [[Garvok, Sword Of Wrath]]
Aura: strong evocation
CL: 16
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 10 lbs.
Description: This scarred piece of crimson stained metal functions similarly to a +5 returning throwing greatsword. Instead of the normal benefit of the throwing weapon special ability, Garvok can be thrown with a 25-foot range increment. Additionally, whenever Garvok strikes a foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Reflex save or take an additional 5d6 points of fire damage. If the sword scores a critical hit, it explodes in a fireball centered on the wielder's opponent. All creatures within the fireball's 20-foot-radius spread-including Garvok's wielder and allies, if within range-take 10d6 points of fire damage (DC 25 Reflex for half). The wielder has no control over the sword's eruption and cannot prevent it from exploding. The sword returns to its wielder's hand, fully reformed, just before the beginning of his next turn.
