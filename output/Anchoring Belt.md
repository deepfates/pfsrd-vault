Name: [[Anchoring Belt]]
Aura: moderate abjuration
CL: 9
Slot: belt
Price: 60,000 gp
Weight: 10 lbs.
Description: This belt looks like nothing more than iron chains connecting large pieces of slate. It grants its wearer a +5 inherent bonus to combat maneuver defense against bull rush, drag, grapple, overrun, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers and a +5 inherent bonus on saving throws against any effect that attempts to move the wearer with physical force or energy. Furthermore, if the wearer is a mythic creature and targeted by an effect that would teleport her, she can choose whether or not she wishes to be teleported. As a standard action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic [[power]] to create a 30-foot-radius aura that affects all enemy creatures within it as though they were subject to a dimensional anchor spell. This aura lasts for a number of rounds equal to the wearer's mythic tier.
