Description: Sculpted into the intricate form of a golden cacodaemon, this ring's wide-open mouth is designed to hold a soul gem created by a cacodaemon. The ring allows its wearer to tap into the residual memories of the mangled soul it encapsulates. Once per day, the wearer may interrogate the soul in the gem, similar to using speak with dead, except the soul answers telepathically. Once per day, the bearer can project the soul's last tormented moments before it was consumed and bound, creating a cone of terror equivalent to a fear spell (DC 16).
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], fear, speak with dead
Cost: 7,500 gp.
