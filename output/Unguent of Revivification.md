Name: [[Unguent of Revivification]]
Aura: faint necromancy
CL: 3
Slot: item
Price: 300 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This foul-smelling gray paste is typically stored in a bone container. When smeared upon a corpse, it preserves that corpse's state of decay for 5 days, as if via the gentle repose spell. If smeared upon a corporeal undead creature, it restores that creature's living appearance for 5 days-this has no effect on the creature's abilities, but does grant it a +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a living creature and imparts a -5 penalty on Knowledge (religion) checks to identify what type of undead creature it is. Unguent of revivification is particularly popular in [[Geb]], where many of that nation's movers and shakers view it as a vanity item to mask the hideous truths of their undead flesh.
