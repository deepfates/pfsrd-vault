Description: These sandals are made of cloth and animal hide stitched to wood blocks that elevate them an inch off the ground. [[Monk]]s often wear them as they roam across the deserts of northern G arund, traveling with no food or water to perfect their physical forms. The wearer of sandstorm sandals leaves no trace while traveling in desert environments. If the wearer possesses the flurry of blows class feature, anytime he makes an unarmed flurry of blows while standing on sand or dirt, a minor storm appears around him for 1 round. Any creature that ends its movement within 5 feet of the wearer during this time takes 1 point of nonlethal damage. While the storm is active, the sandals' wearer gains concealment (20% miss chance).
