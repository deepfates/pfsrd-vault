Name: [[Throne of Ydersius Ascendant]]
Aura: strong abjuration
CL: 18
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 2,000 lbs.
Description: This huge, ornate throne, carved from white marble and inlaid with flickering, smoking, multicolored spirals of serpentstone, is uncomfortably tall and thin for most humans, as it is designed to seat a high priest of the serpentfolk. While seated upon the throne, a divine caster who worships Ydersius may use a spell slot or exchange any prepared divine spell (including domain spells) of 3rd level or higher to cast dispel magic. Once per day, a divine caster of sufficient level may instead cast greater dispel magic in place of a spell of 6th level or higher. This ability is in most other ways identical to the spontaneous casting of [[cleric]]s and [[druid]]s (see the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), but may also be employed by [[anti[[paladin]]]]s, [[inquisitor]]s, [[oracle]]s, or other divine casters faithful to Ydersius. The throne bestows one permanent negative level on any creature that sits upon it, other than divine casters who worship Ydersius. This negative level remains as long as the non-sentient or heretical creature sits upon the throne and disappears when the throne is vacated. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the throne is occupied.
