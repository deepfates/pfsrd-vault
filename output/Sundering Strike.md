name: [[Sundering Strike]]
type: Combat
description: Your critical hits can sunder your foes' weapons.
prerequisites: Str 13, [[Improved Sunder]], [[Power Attack]], base attack bonus +9.
prerequisite_feats: [[Improved Sunder]], [[Power Attack]]
benefit: Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can sunder your opponent's weapon, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may deal damage to your opponent's weapon as if from the sunder combat maneuver (roll normal damage to the weapon separately). This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
normal: You must perform a sunder combat maneuver to sunder an opponent's weapon.
special: You can only apply the effects of one of the following feats to a given critical hit: [[Bull Rush Strike]], [[Disarming Strike]], [[Repositioning Strike]], [[Sundering Strike]], or [[Tripping Strike]]. You may choose to use this feat after you make your confirmation roll.
