Name: [[Hydrodaemon [[Run]]estone]]
Aura: moderate conjuration (evil)
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 3,300 gp
Weight: -
Description: This water-polished stone is carved in the shape of a froglike head and decorated with evil runes. It feels lighter than it should, as if hollow and partially filled with liquid. When the stone is crushed, smashed, or broken (a standard action), a hydrodaemon appears as if summoned by a summon monster spell. Normally, the daemon is under the control of the creature that broke the runestone, but there is a 25% chance that the daemon is uncontrolled and attacks its [[summoner]].
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], summon monster VI
Cost: 1,650 gp
