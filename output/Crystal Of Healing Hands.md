Name: [[Crystal Of [[Heal]]ing Hands]]
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 10
Slot: neck
Price: 12,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: A cloth cord marked with esoteric religious symbols typically holds this roughly cut, glittering prism in place. A person with the lay on hands class feature can direct one use of this energy into the crystal, which stores it until the wearer speaks a command word to release it. Releasing the energy targets the wearer with the stored lay on hands effect, as if touched by the person who infused the crystal with its [[power]]. The crystal can contain a single use of the lay on hands class feature. When filled with this magic, it begins to glow with a pearly white light. The wearer of the crystal can order it to release its energy as a standard action. This acts identically to receiving the effect of lay on hands directly from the person who channeled it into the crystal, including any mercies they had at the time.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], cure light wounds, creator must be a [[paladin]]
