Description: A hex nail is a thick, 6-inch-long nail forged from cold iron. Usually carried like charms or concealed within the heels of shoes, these roughly worked nails are the only protection many common citizens of [[Irrisen]] have against the White [[Witch]]es and the cold fey of the North. Carrying a hex nail grants its possessor a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against the hexes, spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of fey, hags, and [[witch]]es. A hex nail automatically grants its bonus when its possessor is targeted by such an effect. Once a hex nail has granted its bonus on a single saving throw, it becomes a nonmagical nail. Most Jadwiga consider possession of a hex nail an act of treason.
