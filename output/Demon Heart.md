Name: [[Demon Heart]]
Aura: strong abjuration [chaotic, evil]
CL: 13
Slot: item
Price: 6,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This pulsating lump of reddish-black muscle can be implanted only if the recipient's own heart is first removed-removing the recipient's heart deals 2d4 points of Constitution damage and 1 point of Constitution bleed to the recipient, and at the beginning of its next turn the recipient is reduced to -1 hit points and begins dying. Implanting the demon heart requires a successful DC 20 [[Heal]] check made as a full-round action, and causes it to graft itself into the recipient's chest and halt the Constitution bleed. Once in place, the demon heart pumps with unrighteous might-the recipient gains a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against fear effects. In addition, if the recipient is suffering a bleed effect, as a full-round action it can cause the demon heart to flood its bloodstream with tainted ichor, ending the bleed effect but causing it to become nauseated for 1 round.
