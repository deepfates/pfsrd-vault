name: [[Strike Back]]
type: Mythic
description: Your precise counterattacks degrade your foes' advantages in combat.
prerequisites: [[Strike Back]].
prerequisite_feats: [[Strike Back]]
benefit: When you make a melee attack as a readied action against a foe outside your melee reach, you can take a 5-foot step toward that foe. If you expend one use of mythic [[power]], you can move your speed toward the foe instead. Neither of these counts toward the movement made during your turn.
