Name: [[Key Of Lock Jamming]]
Aura: faint abjuration
CL: 1
Slot: item
Price: 400 gp
Weight: 1/2 lb.
Description: This ornate brass key automatically reshapes itself to fit any standard keyhole (generally those in doors scaled for use by Small or [[Medium]] creatures, not deliberately oversized locks like the main door to a dwarven fortress). Once placed inside a lock, the key merges with the lock and fills up all open spaces within it, creating a solid piece of metal and making it impossible to unlock it, even with magic. While securing the lock, the key strengthens its materials, adding +2 to the lock's hardness, +8 to its hit points, and +5 to its Break DC. Touching the key and speaking the command word causes the key to disintegrate, leaving the lock intact and rendering the mechanism operable again.
