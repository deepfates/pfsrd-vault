Description: Fashioned from a scrap of a blind beggar's clothing, a blind man's fold is often used by explorers who must traverse caves inhabited by invisible creatures, or those drawn to sources of light. A blind man's fold fully obscures normal vision while worn, but grants the effects of the Improved [[Blind-Fight]] feat (Advanced Player's Guide 162). Creatures which are unable to see normally gain no benefit from wearing a blind man's fold.
