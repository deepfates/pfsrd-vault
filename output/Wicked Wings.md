CL: 7
Slot: item
Price: 55,000 gp

Description: These ragged wings may be birdlike with moldy feathers, or tattered and membranous like the wings of a bat. The recipient's shoulder blades and collarbones must be broken in order to attach the wicked wings-breaking them deals 2d4 points of Strength and Dexterity damage to the recipient and renders both arms useless until the ability damage heals. The recipient gains a fly speed equal to its normal land speed with average maneuverability. In addition, when not flying a creature with wicked wings is considered to have [[Deflect Arrows]] as a bonus feat.
