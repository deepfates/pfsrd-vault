Name: [[Irradiating Tail]]
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 5,315 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: The end of this +1 viridiumUE long lash tail attachmentARG is a shard of toxic green rock. As with any viridiumUE weapon, a successful hit with an irradiating tail causes the target to contract leprosy-and a critical hit can poison the target with greenblood oil. However, unlike with most viridium weapons, the wielder of an irradiating tail is magically immune to the weapon's toxic effects. The viridium has been strengthened, so the weapon isn't fragile.
