Name: [[Meridian Belt]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 9
Slot: belt
Price: 1,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This narrow cloth belt has a silver buckle in the shape of four rings. The belt allows a creature to wear a magic ring on each foot in addition to the ring on each hand, though only two rings function at any given time. As a swift action, the wearer can change which of his rings are active (both hands, both feet, left hand and right foot, and so on). For example, a creature could wear a ring of protection, ring of energy resistance, ring of swimming, and ring of counterspells, s[[witch]]ing between any two of them as a swift action each round as it desires. The belt does not change the type of action required to activate a ring (for example, activating a ring of invisibility is still a standard action), but allows the wearer to easily s[[witch]] between the constant [[power]]s of several worn rings. While the belt is worn, wearing a ring on a foot counts toward the attunement process of certain rings (such as a ring of sustenance) even if the belt isn't used to make that ring active during that attunement period.
