Description: The sacred weapon known as [[Dawnflower's Kiss]] is [[sai]]d to have been one of a dozen identical weapons created long ago when Sarenrae split open the [[world]] while fighting [[Rovagug]]. When she did this, fragments of the [[world]] turned molten by her blade flew from the battle, landing in remote parts of Golarion where they cooled and transformed into these potent scimitars. The weapons were sought out by her church and were entrusted to her greatest champions. Over time, though, those champions fell and the blades were lost. A [[Dawnflower's Kiss]] is a +4 holy flaming scimitar. Once per round as a standard action, the wielder can slash at the air with a [[Dawnflower's Kiss]] to fire a single bolt of searing light from the weapon. Once per day, the wielder may instead unleash a sunbeam with this standard action. In the hands of a worshiper of Sarenrae, the scimitar becomes a +5 holy flaming burst scimitar that functions as a divine [[focus]] for spellcasting. If used as a divine [[focus]], the scimitar increases the save DC for the spell cast by 1. Finally, by expending one use of mythic [[power]], a worshiper of Sarenrae can as a standard action throw the sword to make a single attack against up to eight targets within 60 feet of her-these attacks [[resolve]] as melee attacks made at the worshiper's highest attack bonus. The [[Dawnflower's Kiss]] found in this adventure was claimed long ago by Baphomet from a [[paladin]] of Sarenrae after her husband betrayed her to the Horned Lord. The blade has been corrupted-it now functions as a +4 unholy flaming scimitar, and none of its other [[power]]s function at all until it is cleansed, such as through the redeemed corruption forge back in Drezen or a miracle spell, or by bringing the scimitar to the unquiet shade of Lady Cessily Mantiel in area H2. When handed the weapon, she sighs in relief and infuses the blade with her spirit, restoring it to full functionality while simultaneously releasing her spirit from the prison.
