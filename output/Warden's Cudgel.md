Name: [[Warden's Cudgel]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 12,150 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: Commonly created by members of the Green Faith, this type of +1 greenwood club is made from knotted wood, is covered in thorns and vines, and looks as though it is still alive. Twice per day when the wielder hits a target with a warden's cudgel, vines, leaves, and roots instantly grow from the target's square in a 15-foot radius. These plants remain for 1 minute and are treated as difficult terrain and natural plant growth for the purposes of the woodland stride class feature. If the area already has brush and trees in it, the plants in the affected area instead grow as the overgrowth version of plant growth.
