Name: [[First [[Aid]] Gloves]]
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 9
Slot: hands
Price: 4,500 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: These fingerless gloves of white cloth have a sapphire decorating the base of each exposed finger, numbering 10 in all. The wearer of a pair of first aid gloves can, as a standard action, cast any of the following spells (caster level 9th), permanently expending a number of sapphires equal to the spell's level (as denoted in parentheses after each spell): breath of life (5), cure critical wounds (4), cure light wounds (1), cure moderate wounds (2), cure serious wounds (3), and mass cure light wounds (5). When casting a spell from the gloves, the wearer can't expend sapphires on different hands, thus only a full hand's worth of gems can be used to cast breath of life or mass cure light wounds. Regardless, both gloves must be worn to function. Once all of the sapphires are expended, a pair of first aid gloves becomes nonmagical.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], breath of life, cure critical wounds, cure light wounds, cure moderate wounds, cure serious wounds, mass cure light wounds
