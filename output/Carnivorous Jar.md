If the creature survives, the resulting trauma deals 2d6 points of bleed damage every round. This bleed damage lasts until the victim receives at least 5 points of magical healing or benefits from a DC 20 [[Heal]] check. A carnivorous jar functions only once, and can be found alone or in sets of four.
