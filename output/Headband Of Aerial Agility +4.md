Name: [[Headband Of Aerial Agility +4]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 8
Slot: headband
Price: 42,000 gp
Weight: -
Description: This headband is decorated with feathers from a number of colorful birds. It grants boons to flying magic, and more [[power]]ful versions grant the [[power]] of flight. The wearer of a headband of aerial agility +2 treats his caster level as if it were one level higher when casting spells or creating extracts that grant flight. A headband of aerial agility +4 gains the same benefits and, on command, grants the wearer the ability to fly (as the fly spell) three times per day. A headband of aerial agility +6 functions like a +4 version, but the headband grants the ability to use fly at will. All versions also grant the wearer an enhancement bonus to one mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) of +2, +4, or +6. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. This bonus is chosen when the headband is created and cannot be changed. If the headband grants a bonus to Intelligence, it also grants skill ranks as a headband of vast intelligence, usually granting ranks in [[Fly]], [[Acrobatic]]s, or Knowledge (planes).
