Description: This billowing white cape renders the wearer almost invisible the moment she is submerged in salt water, granting her concealment (20% miss chance) so long as she remains entirely submerged. The wearer can breathe underwater and gains a swim speed of 20 ft. While the wearer is submerged, the cape surrounds her with tiny stinging tentacles. Any creature that ends its turn adjacent to the wearer takes 1 point of electricity damage and must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw or be sickened for 1 round. The sickened effect is a poison effect.
