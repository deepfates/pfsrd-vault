Aura: overwhelming varied

Weight: 8 lbs.
Description: The [[Horns of Naraga]] was constructed by the Whispering Tyrant not long after he first became a lich. In the centuries since, he has further expanded its [[power]]. When worn by an undead creature, the [[Horns of Naraga]] reduce all damage taken from positive energy by half. In addition, whenever the wearer touches a living creature while wearing this helm (even if the touch is part of casting a spell or another touch attack), the touch deals an additional 5d6 points of negative energy damage and the wearer gains these hit points, just as if he had cast vampiric touch. The wearer of the helm is immune to acid and can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by magic. Once per day, on command, the helm can be ordered to transform into an ancient black dragon that obeys the creature that summoned it unquestioningly for 1 hour before reverting to a helm. Slaying the dragon does not destroy the helm, but it does prevent this ability from being used for 1 week. While the helm is in dragon form, the helm's owner does not receive any of the helm's other benefits.
