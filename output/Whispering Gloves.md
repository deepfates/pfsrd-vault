Name: [[Whispering Gloves]]
Aura: faint illusion and transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: hands
Price: 15,400 gp
Weight: -
Description: These gloves constantly project a very short-range silence spell, so that anything touched or held by the wearer's hands makes no sound. Thus picking a locked door wouldn't make a clicking noise audible to those on the other side, and holding a hand over a victim's mouth would silence his scream. The silence extends only a few inches, so knocking on a door produces no sound but hammering it down still does. If the wearer presses a finger to her lips and speaks, no sound comes out, but the words are audible to anyone she chooses in her line of sight (as the message spell).
Requirements: Requirements [[Craft Wondrous Item]], message, silence
