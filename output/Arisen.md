goal: You meet in person and hear the words of your deity or your deity's chosen herald. If you worship a pantheon of deities, you must meet and hear a member of that pantheon-a herald does not suffice in this case. If you worship no specific deity, you must hear the words of an appropriate entity of the GM's choice.
completion_benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against death effects and fear effects. In addition, the caster level of any conjuration (healing) spell that is cast on you increases by 1 for the purposes of its effects on you alone.
