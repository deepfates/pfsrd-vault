benefit: While inside an artif icial structure, you can spend a free action to make a DC 15 Knowledge (engineering) check when you begin your [[bard]]ic performance. Success on this check allows you to do one of the following. Self-[[Harm]]onize: By performing over the acoustic reverberations of your performance, you increase the DC of your [[bard]]ic performance effects +1.
