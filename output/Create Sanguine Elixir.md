name: [[Create Sanguine Elixir]]
type: General
description: You can condense a fraction of your bloodline's [[power]] into a [[power]]ful elixir.
prerequisites: Cha 15, [[Brew Potion]], Craft (alchemy) 12 ranks, [[sorcerer]] level 3rd.
prerequisite_feats: [[Brew Potion]]
benefit: Once per day, when you clear your mind to regain spell slots, you can create a sanguine elixir. When you do, pick one of your bloodline [[power]]s. You transfer that [[power]] into a small potion that any creature can drink to temporarily gain the benefit of your bloodline [[power]]. Creating a sanguine elixir takes 1 hour, and requires special oils and distillates worth 100 gp, and when you make the sanguine elixir, you lose access to the bloodline [[power]] until the next time you clear your mind to regain spell slots. When a creature drinks a sanguine elixir, it can activate the bloodline [[power]] anytime before the end of its next turn, as if it had access to that bloodline [[power]]. A creature that drinks the elixir cannot gain the benefit if its character level does not equal or exceed the minimum level of the bloodline [[power]]. Any level-dependent effects use the character level of the creature that drinks the sanguine elixir, or your [[sorcerer]] level, whichever is lower. Drinking a sanguine elixir is just like drinking a potion. A sanguine elixir is treated as a magic item with your caster level. Sanguine elixirs are extremely unstable. They lose their potency 1 day after they are created.
