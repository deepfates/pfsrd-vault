This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves.  (Roll separately for each nauseated character.) Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn.  Stinking cloud can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
