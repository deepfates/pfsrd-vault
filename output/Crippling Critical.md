name: [[Crippling Critical]]
type: Combat
description: You are able to maim a target and hinder its movement.
prerequisites: [[Critical Focus]], base attack bonus +13.
prerequisite_feats: [[Critical Focus]]
benefit: Whenever you score a critical hit against an opponent, its speed is halved for 1 minute. A successful Fortitude save reduces this duration to 1d4 rounds. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + your base attack bonus. Against creatures with multiple types of movement, you must choose which movement type to affect. A flying creature hit by this attack must make a DC 10 [[Fly]] check to remain airborne, and has its maneuverability reduced by one step.
normal: 0
special: You can only apply the effects of one critical feat to a given critical hit unless you possess [[Critical Mastery]].
