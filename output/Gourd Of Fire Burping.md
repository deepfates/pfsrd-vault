Description: A lesser version of the elixir of fire breath, a gourd of fire burping can be imbibed as a normal elixir or, in the case of a user with a large enough mouth and low enough standards, be completely consumed in one crunchy gulp. Once the user has consumed the gourd, she can immediately expel a belch of fire in a 15-foot cone, dealing 2d6 points of fire damage to all creatures in the area. A successful DC 12 Reflex save halves the damage. If the user elects not to use the fire breath at once, she can store the breath for up to an hour before it dissipates.
