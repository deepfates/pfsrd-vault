Description: This strange, interdimensional device looks just like a portable hole. Anything placed within it is immediately cast to another [[world]]-a parallel [[world]], another planet, or a different plane (chosen randomly). If the well is moved, it opens to a new plane (also randomly determined). It can be picked up, folded, or rolled, just as a portable hole can be. Objects from the [[world]] the well touches can come through the opening just as easily- it is a two-way portal.
