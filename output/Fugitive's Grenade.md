Aura: faint conjuration and transmutation
CL: 3
Slot: item
Price: 750 gp
Weight: -
Description: These small grenades are made from hollowed eggshells filled with assorted powders and reagents and inscribed with magical glyphs. When broken, a fugitive's grenade creates a 10-foot-radius cloud that lasts for 2 rounds. This cloud is otherwise identical to a fog cloud. A single smoke tendril in the center of the cloud forms a solid-feeling rope, 20 feet long, that functions as a rope trick spell. When the smoke cloud dissipates, so does the smoke rope, though the rope trick's extradimensional space remains for its full duration. Once the smoke rope disperses, any creatures inside the extradimensional space must jump or climb out by other means. A fugitive's grenade may be thrown as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.
