name: [[[[Sleep]]er Hold]]
type: Combat
description: By maintaining a grapple hold on your opponent, you can cause it to lose [[consciousness]].
prerequisites: [[Greater Grapple]], base attack bonus +8.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: You must declare that you are using this feat before you make a combat maneuver check to maintain a grapple (thus a failed check to maintain the grapple ruins the attempt). If you maintain a grapple for a number of consecutive rounds equal to your opponent's Constitution bonus (minimum 1 round), you can attempt to knock out your opponent. The victim must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Str modifier) or else it falls unconscious for 1d4 rounds. Each successive round you attempt this, the target takes a cumulative -1 penalty on its saving throw. When you use this feat, you take an additional -2 penalty to your AC. Creatures that are immune to bleed damage, stunning, or critical hits are immune to this ability.
