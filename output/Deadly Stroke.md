name: [[Deadly Stroke]]
type: Mythic
description: You can kill with a single stroke.
prerequisites: [[Deadly Stroke]].
prerequisite_feats: [[Deadly Stroke]]
benefit: When making a [[Deadly Stroke]] attack, you can expend one use of mythic [[power]] to instantly kill a non-mythic living creature. A Fortitude save (DC 10 + your base attack bonus + your tier) negates this effect, though the attack still deals double damage and Con bleed as [[Deadly Stroke]]. [[Construct]]s, oozes, and creatures immune to critical hits or precision-based damage can't be killed with this feat.
