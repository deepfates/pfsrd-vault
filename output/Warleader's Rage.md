name: [[Warleader's [[Rage]]]]
type: General
description: Your rages are so inspiring to your allies that they don't have to remain adjacent to you to stay raging.
prerequisites: Cha 13, half-orc or orc, non-lawful.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: Feats and abilities that allow an ally to rage or enhance a rage if adjacent to you (such as [[Amplified [[Rage]]]] and [[Sympathetic [[Rage]]]]) persist as long as your ally is within 30 feet of you and can see you. The conditions to activate the rage effect remain unchanged. For example, an ally with [[Sympathetic [[Rage]]]] must be adjacent to you to enter his own rage, but once his rage begins, he can continue raging as long as he can see you and you are within 30 feet.
