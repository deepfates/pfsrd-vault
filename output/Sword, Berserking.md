Description: This sword appears to be a +2 greatsword. However, whenever it is used in battle, its wielder goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the [[barbarian]]'s rage ability). He attacks the nearest creature and continues to fight until unconscious or dead or until no living thing remains within 30 feet. Although many see this sword as a cursed object, others see it as a boon.
