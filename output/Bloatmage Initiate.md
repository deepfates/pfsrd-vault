name: [[Bloatmage Initiate]]
type: General
description: Your introduction to the ways of the bloatmage allows you to use elaborate rituals and gruesome rites to increase the amount of blood and lymph in your body, expanding your reserves of magical energy.
prerequisites: [[Spell Focus]] (any school).
prerequisite_feats: [[Spell Focus]] (any school)
benefit: You learn the basics of the ancient art of hemotheurgy. Pick one school of magic in which you possess the [[Spell Focus]] feat-you cast spells from this school of magic at +1 caster level. This bonus stacks with the bonus from [[Spell Focus]]. Unfortunately, the bloating side effects increase your girth to such a point that you are constantly under the effects of a medium load-your maximum bonus to AC from Dexterity is +3, you gain an [[armor]] check penalty of -3, and your speed decreases as appropriate (generally from 30 feet to 20 feet for a [[Medium]] creature).
