Name: [[Riverseer Plate]]
Aura: moderate divination
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 5,000 gp
Weight: 1/2 lb.
Description: This disc of thick green glass is 12 inches in diameter and has a small, stylized image of a boat acid-etched into its center. When set against the deck of a waterborne vessel, the plate warns of nearby obstacles on or under the water, presenting them as glowing green silhouettes on the glass in relation to the boat etched on the plate's center. A riverseer plate warns of inanimate dangers within a 300-foot radius beyond the vessel in which it is set, providing a +6 competence bonus on [[sai]]ling checks to navigate the vessel around potential dangers (see Ultimate Combat for the full rules on [[sai]]ling checks). Once per day, a creature can apply a drop of blood to a riverseer plate's surface. For 5 minutes thereafter, the plate marks the location of Small or larger animate creatures in the water around the vessel, presenting them on the plate's surface as glowing red dots.
