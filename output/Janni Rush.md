name: [[Janni Rush]]
type: Combat
description: When you leap to the attack, your blows are like bolts from on high.
prerequisites: [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Janni Style]], [[Janni Tempest]], [[Acrobatic]]s 8 ranks, Perform (dance) 8 ranks.
prerequisite_feats: [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Janni Style]], [[Janni Tempest]]
benefit: While using [[Janni Style]], you are always considered to have a running start when jumping. Further, if you jump as part of a charge and make an unarmed strike against the designated opponent, a hit allows you to roll the unarmed strike's damage dice twice and add the results together before adding modifiers (such as from Strength) or extra dice (such as precision-based damage or dice from weapon abilities). The extra damage dice are not multiplied on a successful critical hit.
