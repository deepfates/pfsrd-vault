CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 82,000 gp
Weight: 8 lbs.
Description: This variant rod of rulership (Ultimate Equipment 183) looks like a castoff piece of wood from a lumber mill. Originating from the earliest insurrections of G alt, these rods have become symbolic among rebel leaders in the struggling nation. A rod of revolution's wielder can activate the device as a standard action to incite rebellious urges in creatures within 120 feet. The wielder can incite a number of creatures totaling 300 Hit Dice, but creatures with a Wisdom score of 12 or higher can attempt a DC 16 Will save to negate the effect. Incited creatures gain the benefits of the rage spell, but adhere to only the most basic commands issued by the wielder (such as directions about where to move and who to attack). The rod can be used for 500 total minutes before it crumbles to dust. These minutes need not be continuous.
