Name: [[Fleshwarped Scorpion's Tail]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 18,505 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: This +1 scorpion whipUE is made from the tail of a giant cave scorpion. Three times per day, it allows the wielder to use a poison effect (as the spell, save DC 15) upon a creature struck by the whip. The wielder can decide to use the [[power]] after she has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the poison effect must be invoked in the same round that the whip strikes. In addition, the fleshwarped scorpion's tail can be attached to (or removed from) a willing or helpless creature with 1 hour of surgery and a successful DC 20 [[Heal]] check. Whether or not the surgery is successful, the creature takes 1d4 points of Constitution damage. While the tail is attached, the creature gains a natural sting attack that deals damage as the fleshwarped scorpion's tail (including the enhancement bonus and ability to use the poison effect three times per day). The save DC for the poison effect becomes 10 + 1/2 the creature's Hit Dice + its Constitution modifier.
