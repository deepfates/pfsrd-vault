name: [[Power Attack]]
type: Mythic
description: Your attacks are truly devastating.
prerequisites: [[Power Attack]].
prerequisite_feats: [[Power Attack]]
benefit: When you use [[Power Attack]], you gain a +3 bonus on melee damage rolls instead of +2. When your base attack bonus reaches +4 and every 4 points thereafter, the amount of bonus damage increases by +3 instead of +2. In addition, the bonus damage from this feat is doubled on a critical hit, before it's multiplied by the weapon's critical multiplier. You can expend one use of mythic [[power]] when you activate [[Power Attack]] to ignore the penalties on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks for 1 minute.
