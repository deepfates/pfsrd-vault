Name: [[Nightstone Of Sorrow]]
Aura: faint abjuration [evil]
CL: 3
Slot: neck
Price: 3,300 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This black rock, usually worn on a heavy chain, looks pitted and partially charred and melted. It gives the impression of reckless evil-more a dangerous scent than any other kind of feeling. The wearer gains fire resistance 1 and a +1 resistance bonus on Will saves against fear. If the wearer takes 10 or more points of fire damage in a single round, a claw-shaped pattern glows faintly on the surface of the stone, similar to an arcane mark. If the dragon god Dahak is the wearer's patron, the wearer can use shatter once per day. At will, the wearer can cause the claw-symbol on the rock to glow; true dragons immediately recognize the symbol as an icon of Dahak.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], arcane mark, remove fear, resist energy, shatter
Cost: 1,650 gp
