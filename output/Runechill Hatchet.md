Name: [[[[Run]]echill Hatchet]]
Aura: moderate necromancy
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 5,312 gp
Weight: 6 lbs.
Description: [[Run]]echill hatchets are sized for Large creatures, but resizes so it can be wielded by [[Medium]] creatures as battleaxes or Small creatures as greataxes. Their blades are jagged and carved with Thassilonian runes, and the weapons always feel cold to the touch. A runechill hatchet otherwise functions as a +1 battleaxe, but once per day as a free action, its wielder can cause the runes on the blade to flare up with flickering cold blue light. For the next 5 rounds, the axe deals an additional +1d6 points of negative energy damage on a hit. Any creature that takes any amount of this additional negative energy damage must also succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or take 1 point of Strength damage. An undead creature struck by a runechill hatchet does not gain this negative energy as healing, but instead must make a DC 12 Will saving throw or flee as if panicked for 1d4+5 rounds.
