Name: [[Braid Of A Hundred Masters]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: neck
Price: 5,200 gp
Weight: -
Description: This elaborate braid is made of strands of hair from a hundred martial arts masters. If the wearer has levels in [[monk]], his fast movement and unarmed damage are treated as a [[monk]] of 3 levels higher. If the character is not a [[monk]], he gains the fast movement and unarmed damage of a 3rd-level [[monk]]. This fast movement functions just like the [[monk]]'s fast movement class feature. These bonuses do not stack with those granted by other items or effects. In addition, as a swift action three times per day, a character with the flurry of blows class feature can use the Braid of a Hundred Masters to apply 1-1/2 times his Strength bonus on damage rolls for successful attacks made with flurry of blows. This ability must be activated before the damage from the attack is rolled, though it may be activated after the attack roll is made and before the damage roll. Once this ability is activated, its effect lasts for 1 round.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], longstrider, stone fist (Advanced Player's Guide 247)
