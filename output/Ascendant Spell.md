name: [[Ascendant Spell]]
type: Metamagic
description: You have learned how to emulate mythic spells using non-mythic forces.
prerequisites: 0
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: You can modify a spell to imitate the mythic version of that spell. An ascendant spell uses the mythic version of the spell, but doesn't count as a mythic spell for the purposes of effects that interact with the spell, unless you are a mythic creature. You can't use the augmented version of the mythic spell, or use spells effects that require you to expend uses of mythic [[power]] (even if you have uses of mythic [[power]] available). An ascendant spell uses up a spell slot 5 levels higher than the spell's actual level.
