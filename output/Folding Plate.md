Name: [[Folding Plate]]
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 10
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 12,650 gp
Weight: 50 lbs.
Description: This item normally looks like a heavy steel brooch or cloak clasp, often depicting a heavy helm or sturdy shield. On command, the brooch transforms in a clatter of metallic plates and panels to instantly cover the wearer in a complete suit of +1 full plate, with the design of the brooch displayed on the [[armor]]'s breastplate. The same command word causes the [[armor]] to transform into the brooch. The brooch only transforms if the wearer's [[armor]] slot is unoccupied, thus it won't work if the wearer is already [[armor]]ed. The brooch associated with this [[armor]] weighs less than a pound and occupies the neck slot when in this form.
