name: [[Heighten Spell]]
type: Metamagic
description: You can cast spells as if they were a higher level.
prerequisites: 0
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: A heightened spell has a higher spell level than normal (up to a maximum of 9th level). Unlike other metamagic feats, [[Heighten Spell]] actually increases the effective level of the spell that it modifies. All effects dependent on spell level (such as saving throw DCs and ability to penetrate a lesser globe of invulnerability) are calculated according to the heightened level. The heightened spell is as difficult to prepare and cast as a spell of its effective level.
