Name: [[Floating Sail, 20-Ft.-By-50-Ft.]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 32,000 gp
Weight: 20 lbs.
Description: This silk cloth is folded into a neat triangle and tied with a gold ribbon. If the command word is spoken, a floating [[sai]]l unfurls up to its full size in an area chosen by the speaker and becomes a rigid sheet of cloth capable of supporting a large amount of weight. When the command word is uttered a second time, the floating [[sai]]l folds up into a triangle in a space chosen by the speaker (this space must be one that the floating [[sai]]l was touching while unfurled). If the floating [[sai]]l is bearing any weight when commanded to fold up, it collapses and takes the form of a normal silk [[sai]]l; depending on whether the [[sai]]l was placed on water, over a gap, or in a similarly perilous location, any creatures standing on it may become entangled in the [[sai]]l, fall to their doom, or worse (at the GM's discretion, those who succeed at a Reflex save may avoid disaster). Similarly, a floating [[sai]]l immediately collapses if its weight capacity is exceeded. A collapsed floating [[sai]]l must be picked up and refolded by hand before it can be activated again.
