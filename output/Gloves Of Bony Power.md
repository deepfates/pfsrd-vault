Price: 5,400 gp
Weight: -
Description: These black gloves are decorated with images of white bones, as if revealing the bones within the wearer's hands. The left glove can be used once per day to create a spectral hand, which makes the bony hand image on that glove slide off and manifest as a ghostly skeletal hand for the duration of the effect. The right glove can be used once per day to deliver an inflict moderate wounds spell, which gives that hand's bones a pale, sickly glow until the touch is delivered or discharged. If the wearer is a living creature, he can also use the right glove on himself to cast cure moderate wounds instead of inflict moderate wounds.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], cure moderate wounds, inflict moderate wounds, spectral hand
