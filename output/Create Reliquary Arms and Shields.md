name: [[Create Reliquary Arms and [[Shield]]s]]
type: General
description: Your magical creations are infused with divine [[power]].
prerequisites: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], ability to cast consecrate or desecrate.
prerequisite_feats: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]]
benefit: When you craft a magic weapon, magic [[armor]], or magic shield, you may add one casting of consecrate or desecrate as part of the item crafting process. This increases the item's Price by 250 gp. The item becomes a reliquary and can be used as a holy (or unholy) symbol divine [[focus]] of your deity. If you cast consecrate or desecrate, your reliquary counts as a permanent fixture for that spell while it remains in the spell's area.
