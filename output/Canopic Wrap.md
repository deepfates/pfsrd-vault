Name: [[Canopic Wrap]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 7
Slot: belt
Price: 10,500 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Tattered and yellowed, this belt is made up of dozens of interwoven linen wraps bound together by a simple stone buckle at the front. Crafted from mummifies' wrappings, these belts are commonly used by explorers in the vast deserts of what was once Ancient [[Osirion]]. While worn, the belt grants a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against disease, including supernatural diseases such as mummy rot. A canopic wrap also causes strange internal shifts in key organs, moving them randomly within the body. Because of this odd effect, the wearer gains the benefits of the light fortificationUE [[armor]] special ability. This effect also plays havoc on trained healers, however, increasing the DC of any [[Heal]] check used on the wearer by 5.
