benefit: You no longer take a penalty to AC for using [[Archon Style]] to grant nearby allies a bonus to AC against a single opponent, and you can spend a swift action instead of a move action to use this ability. Whenever you take damage from using [[Archon Diversion]] to divert an opponent's attack toward yourself, any allies threatening your opponent can make an attack of opportunity against the diverted opponent.
