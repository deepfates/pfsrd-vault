Name: [[[[Sorcerer]]'s Robe]]
Aura: moderate evocation
CL: 10
Slot: body
Price: 5,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This dapper robe enables a [[sorcerer]] to add the effects of her 1st-level bloodline [[power]] to spells she casts. As a swift action before casting a spell, the wearer expends one use of her 1st-level bloodline [[power]] and selects one target of the spell to be affected by that bloodline [[power]]. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save against the spell means the bloodline [[power]] deals half damage (if it normally deals hit point damage) or is negated (if it does not). The robe can be used up to three times per day.
