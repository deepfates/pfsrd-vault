name: [[Planar Wild Shape]]
type: General
description: You can infuse your wild shape with planar strength.
prerequisites: Wild shape class feature, Knowledge (planes) 5 ranks.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: When you use wild shape to take the form of an animal, you can expend an additional daily use of your wild shape class feature to add the celestial template or fiendish template to your animal form. (Good [[druid]]s must use the celestial template, while evil [[druid]]s must use the fiendish template.) If your form has the celestial template and you score a critical threat against an evil creature while using your form's natural weapons, you gain a +2 bonus on the attack roll to confirm the critical hit. The same bonus applies if your form has the fiendish template and you score a critical threat against a good creature.
