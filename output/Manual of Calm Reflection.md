Others teach mental exercises to hone the wits and sharpen the senses. The manual of calm reflection, a thick book of 30 chapters, aids the reader in centering his spirit and anchors him within himself. After spending 1 hour reading the book, the reader gains a +1 bonus on saves against mind-affecting spells for the duration of that day. If [[Irori]] is your patron, this bonus increases to +2.
