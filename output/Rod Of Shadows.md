Name: [[Rod Of Shadows]]
Aura: moderate abjuration
CL: 8
Slot: item
Price: 64,305 gp
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This ebon rod is so dark it seems to absorb the light around it. The rod functions as a +2 light mace, and allows its wielder to see in darkness as if she had the see in darkness ability (Bestiary 2 301). Three times per day, the wielder can use it to create a deeper darkness effect (caster level 8th). To use this ability, the rod's wielder must touch the target object, which is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity.
