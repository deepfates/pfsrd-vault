Description: The [[Mantis Blade]] is an intelligent +2 axiomatic sawtooth sabre (Inner Sea World Guide) made of red chitin that forms a curved, serrated blade. It grants its wielder the ability to make a +1d6 sneak attack. This ability functions exactly like the [[rogue]] ability of the same name, and stacks with any sneak attack bonuses the wielder may already have. When a creature is wounded with the blade, as a swift action the wielder can activate the blade's bane weapon special ability (granting the weapon an additional +2 enhancement bonus and causing it to do an extra 2d6 points of damage, but only against the type of creature struck; see page 469 of the Core Rulebook). The bane ability lasts for 10 minutes and is usable once per day. Sacred to the faith of the mantis god Achaekek, the [[Mantis Blade]] also grants bonuses to a Red Mantis assassin who wields it. A Red Mantis assassin wielding the [[Mantis Blade]] gains a +2 bonus to the DC of her prayer attack, and may use her red shroud and fading abilities each an additional time per day. (See page 282 of The Inner Sea World Guide for more details on the Red Mantis assassin prestige class).
