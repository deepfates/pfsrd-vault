Name: [[Mammoth Lance]]
Aura: moderate enchantment
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 32,310 gp
Weight: 10 lbs.
Description: This +2 lance is made out of white spruce wood with a handle carved from mammoth tusk ivory. Its shaft is decorated with images of charging mammoths or running wolves. When wielded while mounted on a creature with the animal type, a mammoth lance uses the mount's Strength modifier on damage rolls rather than the wielder's Strength modifier. When its wielder is not mounted, or is mounted on a creature without the animal type, a mammoth lance functions as a normal +2 lance.
Requirements: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], animal growth, bull's strength
