Name: [[Terendelev's Scales]]
Aura: strong (varies)
CL: 19
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: -
Description: These palm-sized silver dragon scales are [[unique]] items-essentially minor artifacts resulting from Terendelev's death on the Storm King's blade. Each of Terendelev's scales grants a different [[power]] to the person who carries them. The [[power]]s granted do not function at all if more than one scale is carried. The [[power]]s of the four scales are listed below-any nonevil creature that handles a scale immediately understands its use. Cloudwalking: Three times per day as a standard action, a scale can be used to cast levitate. A pillar of roiling clouds rises below the levitating object or creature, growing and shrinking with the target's altitude. This pillar is 5 feet in diameter (regardless of the target's size) and provides concealment (20% miss chance) to any creature or object wholly contained within. Disguise: Three times per day as a standard action, a scale can be used to cast alter self. While disguised, the target gains a +4 bonus on all Bluff checks made against evil creatures. [[Resistance]]: Three times per day as a standard action, a scale can be used to cast resist elements-but only against electricity or cold. Sacred Weaponry: Three times per day as a standard action, a scale can be used to cast align weapon, but only to make a weapon lawful or good. Unlike a normal align weapon spell, this effect can be cast on an unarmed strike or natural weapon.
