Name: [[Horn Of Plenty]]
Aura: moderate enchantment
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 6,500 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: This hollowed-out horn comes in four varieties: a horn of plentiful goods, a horn of plentiful labor, a horn of plentiful influence, and a horn of plentiful magic. Each variety carries the same construction requirements but offers a different benefit. The horn's type must be determined at creation and cannot later be changed. If the horn is random, roll a d4 to determine which type of horn it is. A horn of plenty may be blown once per week of downtime to improve the rate at which its bearer can exchange capital. On command, a horn of plentiful goods, labor, or influence allows a creature to trade any 2 points of a single type of capital in exchange for 1 point of either Goods, Labor, or Influence, as indicated by the item's name. (For instance, a horn of plentiful goods allows a creature to trade 2 points of any one kind of capital for 1 point of Goods.) This effect lasts for 1 day. If you are already trading two single types of capital for one other type of capital, at the GM's discretion, blowing the horn allows you to trade on a 1-to-1 basis. A horn of plentiful magic acts similarly to the aforementioned horns, but instead allows a character to trade 3 points of either Goods, Labor, or Influence for 1 point of Magic.
