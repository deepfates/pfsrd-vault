Description: This metal-studded bridle can be attached to any creature with a burrowing speed that is made friendly or helpless. The bridle grants anyone who mounts the bridled creature a +4 competence bonus on Ride, Handle [[Animal]], and wild empathy checks to control the bridled creature. An equipped burrower's bridle allows the user to calm and train (with Handle [[Animal]] or wild empathy) any creatures with a burrow speed and an Intelligence score of less than 3-not just animals or magical beasts. The bridle also allows a creature riding a burrowing creature to accompany it underground while it burrows, but does not grant the ability to breathe underground.
