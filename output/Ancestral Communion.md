description: You contact the [[spirits]] of your ancestors and use their great wisdom to bolster your own knowledge. Consulting with the [[spirits]] is a full-round action. If you consult with the [[spirits]] before making a Knowledge check, you gain a +4 insight bonus on the check. If you have already failed at a Knowledge check, you may consult with your ancestors and make another attempt. The insight bonus on these checks increases to +6 at caster level 7th and +8 at caster level 11th. You may consult with the [[spirits]] for this purpose as often as you like while the spell remains in effect. Only you can hear the [[spirits]] speak to you.
