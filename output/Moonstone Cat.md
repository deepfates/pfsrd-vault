Name: [[Moonstone Cat]]
Aura: moderate enchantment
CL: 7
Slot: item
Price: 12,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This fist-sized statue of a curled-up cat is crafted from gleaming moonstone. When the statue is placed upon the chest of a helpless creature, it briefly animates and stretches like a real cat waking up from a fitful sleep, then curls up again. When this happens, the helpless creature is lulled into a deep sleep, and doesn't awaken until the cat is removed from its chest. If the creature placing the cat expends three uses of mythic [[power]] while doing so, the helpless creature can't be awoken for a week, even if the cat is removed. If the user instead expends six uses of mythic [[power]], the helpless creature can't be awoken for a month. If the user expends 10 uses, the helpless creature can't be awoken for a year. If the user expends 20 uses, the helpless creature can't be awoken for an entire century. While in this sleep, the helpless creature's heart rate and breathing slow to a barely perceptible rate. It doesn't need to eat or drink, though it must still breathe and it ages normally while in this magical sleep. A wish, miracle, or mythic break enchantment can end this magical sleep.
