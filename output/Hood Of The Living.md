Price: 2,840 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This simple leather coif is of a style popular along the [[Crusader]] Road and throughout northern Avistan. The wearer gains a +2 resistance bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting effects created by undead creatures. Three times per day, the wearer may activate the hood of the living to detect the auras of any undead creatures within a 30-foot radius. Doing so is a full-round action that discloses the presence of any undead auras, the number of undead auras, and the direction of the nearest undead aura, as though the user had concentrated for 3 rounds while using detect undead. When activated, a hood of the living also detects any living creatures within a 30-foot radius that are acting under the effects of a charm or compulsion created by an undead creature. This effect only reveals the presence of such creatures, not their number or location.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], detect undead, protection from evil
