Name: [[Rod Of Foiled Magic]]
Aura: strong (no school)
CL: 17
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This rod is similar in appearance to a metamagic rod. Once a creature picks up such a rod, it cannot be discarded without use of a remove curse spell or similar magic. Each time the wielder casts a spell, he takes the rod of foiled magic in hand and treats the caster level of the spell as 2 levels lower. If this would reduce the caster level to 0 or lower, than the caster has only a 50% chance of casting the spell (any chance of arcane spell failure is added to this percentile chance), but if he is able to cast the spell, the spell has a caster level of 1st.
