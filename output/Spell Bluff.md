name: [[Spell Bluff]]
type: General
description: You know the principles of arcane dueling, and when fighting other spellcasters, you have learned to hide the true nature of your spells until the last possible moment.
prerequisites: Bluff 5 ranks, Spellcraft 5 ranks.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: If another spellcaster tries to counterspell your casting, she adds +4 to her Spellcraft DC when trying to determine your spell.
