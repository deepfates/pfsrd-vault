Name: [[Gem of [[Dream]]s]]
Aura: strong necromancy
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: No record of where Kamaria found this potent artifact exists, although many believe she discovered it while exploring a remote corner of the nightmare realm of Leng. The [[Gem of [[Dream]]s]] can be used once per month to absorb the dreaming mind of any sleeping creature it is in contact with-this ability must be activated as a full-round action. The sleeping creature can resist this doom by making a DC 20 Will save-with a success, he is afflicted by a nightmare spell (CL 20th) but is otherwise unharmed. If he fails the save, his dreaming mind is stolen, warped, and then siphoned back into his body in the space of an hour. If the victim is awakened before this process completes, his body twists and transforms into a creature known as a dream eater (see above), at which point only wish or miracle (or the destruction of the [[Gem of [[Dream]]s]]) can restore him to his true form. At the point the transformation occurs, the creature that activated the gem's [[power]] ceases to age for a month. By using the gem every month (and creating more and more dream eaters), a person can effectively become immortal in this manner. While this is technically nothing more than a beneficial side effect, it is this [[power]] that has generated the majority of the gem's legendary fame.
