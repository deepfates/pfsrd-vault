name: [[Crane Riposte]]
type: Combat
description: You use your defensive abilities to make over[[power]]ing counterattacks.
prerequisites: [[Crane Style]], [[Crane Wing]], [[Dodge]], [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], base attack bonus +8 or [[monk]] level 7th.
prerequisite_feats: [[Crane Style]], [[Crane Wing]], [[Dodge]], [[Improved Unarmed Strike]]
benefit: You take only a -1 penalty on attack rolls for fighting defensively. Whenever you are fighting defensively, and you use [[Crane Wing]] to add a dodge bonus against one attack, that attack provokes an attack of opportunity from you if it misses. In addition, when you deflect an attack using [[Crane Wing]] while taking the total defense action, you may make an attack of opportunity against that opponent (even though you could not normally do so while taking the total defense action).
