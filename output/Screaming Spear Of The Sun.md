Name: [[Screaming Spear Of The Sun]]
Aura: strong divination and enchantment
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 4 lbs.
Description: This +4 wounding throwing longspear has a 2-foot-long iron spearhead covered with over 30 cruel flesh barbs. On a critical hit, the barbs lodge in the victim's flesh and can be removed only by tearing the blade free. Yanking the blade free is a full-round action that requires a successful Strength check with a DC equal to the attack roll that struck the critical hit, and deals 3d6 points of damage to the victim. In the hands of a mythic creature, the spear gains the returning special ability, and when thrown seemingly comes alive, screaming wickedly as it flies. When it hits a creature, it radiates fear (as the spell) in a 60-foot-radius burst surrounding the creature struck. Each use of mythic [[power]] the wielder expends when throwing the spear increases the spear's throwing range by 100 feet.
