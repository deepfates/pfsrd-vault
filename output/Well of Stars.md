Name: [[Well of Stars]]
Aura: strong conjuration
CL: 17
Slot: item
Price: 60,000 gp
Weight: -
Description: Rather than opening to locations on different planes, this well instead opens to [[world]]s on the Material Plane. It does not, however, necessarily open to [[world]]s with similar environments to that of its user; hence it can pose much the same danger as the traditional well in terms of both the unpredictable environs of the destination and the alien beings that might step through from the other side.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], gate
Cost: 30,000 gp
Group: Wondrous Item
