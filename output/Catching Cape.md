Name: [[Catching Cape]]
Aura: faint abjuration
CL: 1
Slot: shoulders
Price: 200 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: This silvery cape furls and ripples like a flag with every step its owner takes. As a swift action, the wearer can order the cape to transform into a faint sphere of force that surrounds him on all sides. The field grants the wearer concealment (20% miss chance) against ranged attacks and lasts for 1 minute or until the wearer is missed by a ranged attack due to the [[power]] of the cloak, whichever comes first. When the field is used, all magic is lost from the cloak, leaving only a mundane silvery garment.
