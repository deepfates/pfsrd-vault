Aura: moderate enchantment
CL: 7
Slot: shoulders
Price: 20,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: The forest-green cloak grants a +5 competence bonus on Diplomacy and Sense Motive checks. In addition, once per day, before making a Diplomacy or Sense Motive check, the wearer can decide to call upon the [[power]]s of the cloak to roll twice and take the better result. Finally, the wearer of this cloak can adjust a creature's attitude up to three steps when using Diplomacy, instead of the normal limit of two steps. However, the cloak's [[power]] does have one drawback. Should the wearer ever fail a Diplomacy checks made to adjust a creature's attitude by 5 or more, the creature's attitude is reduced by two steps instead of one.
