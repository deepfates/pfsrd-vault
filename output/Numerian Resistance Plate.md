Name: [[[[Numeria]]n [[Resistance]] Plate]]
Aura: moderate abjuration
CL: 6
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 16,350 gp
Weight: 30 lbs.
Description: [[Numeria]]ns who oppose the Technic League have developed many forms of protection from the tyrannical organization's technology-infused weaponry. This +2 breastplate is made of scrap metal from one of the alien ruins that pepper the landscape, remnants of the crashed spaceship now known as Silver [[Mount]]. Specifically designed to provide additional defense against beam weapons, [[Numeria]]n resistance plate grants its wearer a +4 bonus to touch AC against ray attacks. Three times per day, when a ray attack targeting the plate's wearer misses by 4 or less, the wearer can deflect the ray back at its source as an immediate action. The ray uses the original attack roll to determine whether it hits its new target.
