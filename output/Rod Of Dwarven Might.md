Description: This dwarven version of the more famous rod of lordly might has no spell-like [[power]]s; however, when wielded by a dwarf, it increases all AC, attack roll, CMD, CMB, and saving throw bonuses from a dwarf's racial traits by +1. The rod shares the mundane [[power]]s of a rod of lordly might, but its magical weapon forms are tailored to dwarven preferences. • In its normal form, the rod can be used as a +1 returning light hammer. • When button 1 is pushed, the rod becomes a +3 dwarven longhammer. • When button 2 is pushed, the rod becomes a +4 dwarven waraxe. • When button 3 is pushed, the rod becomes a +2 [[light crossbow]] or +2 heavy crossbow.
