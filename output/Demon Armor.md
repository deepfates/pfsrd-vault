Name: [[Demon Armor]]
Aura: strong necromancy [evil]
CL: 13
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 52,260 gp
Weight: 50 lbs.
Description: This plate [[armor]] is fashioned to make the wearer appear to be a demon. Glowing red energy emanates from sigils engraved on the [[armor]]'s key plates and joints, and the runes intermittently surge with fiendish [[power]]. This +4 full plate allows the wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a contagion spell (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of contagion requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The "claws" are built into the [[armor]]'s vambraces and gauntlets, and cannot be disarmed. A suit of demon [[armor]] is infused with evil, and as a result it bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it. This negative level persists as long as the [[armor]] is worn and disappears when the [[armor]] is removed. The negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the [[armor]] is worn.
