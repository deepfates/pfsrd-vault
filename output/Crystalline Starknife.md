Aura: moderate evocation
CL: 13
Slot: item
Price: 20,324 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: The original crystalline starknife was the weapon of Nugloss, a [[power]]ful priestess of [[Desna]] who fought for the Linnorm Kings during the Winter War. Made of a crystal-like substance similar in appearance to ice but as hard as steel, a crystalline starknife is a +2 starknife that deals +1d6 points of damage against crystalline creatures, as the weapon's edges are particularly adept at shattering and weakening such foes. When thrown in conditions of bright or normal light, a crystalline starknife catches the light and creates a whirling disk of prismatic color. A creature hit by a crystalline starknife thrown in such conditions becomes dazzled for 1 round-or dazed for 1 round on a critical hit. A successful DC 14 Will save negates the dazzled or dazed condition. When thrown by a worshiper of [[Desna]], a crystalline starknife gains the returning weapon special ability.
