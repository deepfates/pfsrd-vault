Description: This golden gem-studded helmet acts like a crown of conquest and grants its wielder three performance or teamwork feats. The wearer can use each of these feats as if it were on his feat list. Once chosen, at the time of the item's creation, these feats cannot be changed. The helmet must be worn for 24 hours in order to gain the teamwork or performance feats. Furthermore this helmet can speak through a central ruby that sits over the nose guard of the helmet. It knows Common and four other languages. These helmets are always confident-even arrogant-and give a running commentary of the battle, praising heroism, chiding tactical missteps, and giving its wearer and its allies martial advice. It has the following other [[power]]s. • Three times per day, it can affect its wearer or an ally within 30 feet as the true strike spell. • Three times per day, it can attempt to demoralize all enemies within 30 feet as a free action, as if using the Intimidate skill. The helmet's Intimidate is bonus +17.
