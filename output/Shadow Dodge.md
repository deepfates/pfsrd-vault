name: Shadow [[Dodge]]
type: General
description: You use light and darkness to your advantage, confusing your enemies and confounding their senses.
prerequisites: Dex 13, worshiper of [[Norgorber]].
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: You are able to use the light around you to move back and forth from shadow to light again, and your sudden shifting dazzles your enemies' eyes. By spending a number of feet (in 10-foot increments) when you use this feat to move from one square to another and back again, you gain a [[Dodge]] bonus to your AC. This bonus is equal to +1 for every 10 feet you spend moving like this. You do not provoke an attack of opportunity while using this ability. Enemies who do not use sight in order to pinpoint your location or who are otherwise able to locate you more precisely (such as creatures that possess blindsight, tremorsense, or true seeing) ignore this AC bonus. Likewise, this feat is ineffective in areas of darkness or bright light, where one cannot readily shift between light and shadow.
