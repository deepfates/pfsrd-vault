Description: Crafted from the tailbones of Kazavon, the Staff of the Slain is an intelligent +5 spell storing shock quarterstaff that grants its wielder a +4 enhancement bonus to Intelligence. In addition, the staff allows the wielder to change the energy type of any spell he casts that deals energy damage to electricity (such as causing a fireball to deal electricity damage). The staff harbors two personalities: the neutral good [[wizard]] Kolwyddon (dominant during the day) and the dragon Kazavon (dominant at night). Some of the staff's [[power]]s change depending on the time of day and which personality is in control.
