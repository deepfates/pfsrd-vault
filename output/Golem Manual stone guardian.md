Name: [[Golem Manual stone]] guardian
Aura: Strong abjuration and enchantment
CL: 14
Slot: item
Price: 44,000 gp
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: A golem manual contains information, incantations, and magical [[power]] that help a character to craft a golem (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). The instructions therein grant a +5 competence bonus on skill checks made to craft the golem's body. Each manual also holds the prerequisite spells needed for a specific golem (although these spells can only be used to create a golem and cannot be copied), effectively granting the builder use of the Craft [[Construct]] feat during the construction of the golem, and an increase to her caster level for the purpose of crafting a golem. The spells included in a golem manual require a spell trigger activation and can be activated only to assist in the construction of a golem. The cost of the book does not include the cost of constructing the golem's body. Once the golem is finished, the writing in the manual fades and the book is consumed in flames. When the book's ashes are sprinkled upon the golem, it becomes fully animated. Stone Golem Guardian Manual: The book contains geas/quest, imbue with spell-like ability, limited wish, polymorph any object, shield other, and slow. The reader may treat her caster level as three levels higher than normal for the purpose of crafting a stone golem guardian.
Requirements: Craft [[Construct]], creator must be caster level 14th, antimagic field, geas/quest, imbue with spell-like ability, limited wish, polymorph any object, shield other, slow
