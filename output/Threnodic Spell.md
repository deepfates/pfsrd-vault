name: [[Threnodic Spell]]
type: Metamagic
description: You can convert mind-affecting magic to necromantic [[power]] capable of controlling undead.
prerequisites: Knowledge (religion) 6 ranks, [[Spell Focus]] (necromancy).
prerequisite_feats: [[Spell Focus]] (necromancy)
benefit: This feat only works on mind-affecting spells. A threnodic spell affects undead creatures (even mindless undead) as if they weren't immune to mind-affecting effects, but has no effect on living creatures. A threnodic spell uses up a spell slot two level higher than the spell's actual level.
normal: [[Undead]] are immune to mind-affecting effects.
