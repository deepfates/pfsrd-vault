Description: This rough, leathery hide is peeled from the body of a demon in strips-it may be scaly, warty, scabrous, or even covered in rank, greasy fur or feathers. To be grafted with demonhide, the recipient must first have its own skin flayed off, taking 1d4 points each of Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma damage in the process. Once grafted, demonhide grants the wearer a +1 natural [[armor]] bonus to Armor Class and resistance 5 to electricity. In addition, the recipient is immune to contact poison and gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against poisons delivered by injury (including those delivered by a touch attacks).
