Name: [[Talisman of the Orc Mother's Fury]]
Aura: faint conjuration
CL: 4
Slot: neck
Price: 12,000 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This small statuette-carved from the tusk of a dire boar, chunks of twisted metal, or some manner of dark stone-is a simplistic depiction of a pregnant deity, fiend, or orc. Dark stains mark the face of the crude icon, typically smears of a fallen orc's blood. A simple strand of leather affixes the amulet around the neck. The figurine allows the wearer to act normally for a single round after being reduced to less than 0 hit points, as though he had the orc ferocity half-orc racial ability. A wearer with orc blood is instead treated as though he had the [[Diehard]] feat. If the wearer is of orc blood and already has the [[Diehard]] feat, he may act normally for an additional round after being reduced to below 0 hit points. Whenever the wearer of the talisman is reduced to less than 0 hit points, the amulet weeps tears of blood. Should the wearer be slain, the talisman screams and shatters.
Requirements: creator must be female and possess orc blood, [[Craft Wondrous Item]], cure moderate wounds
