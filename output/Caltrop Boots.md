Name: [[Caltrop Boots]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: feet
Price: 10,000 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: These knee-high black leather boots have prominent and irregularly shaped heels which seem to bulge from the rest of the shoe. As a swift action, the boots' wearer can cause the boots to let loose a spray of caltrops through the back of the heels as he moves during the remainder of his round. These caltrops fill each square the wearer moves into during that round. Any creature, including the wearer, occupying or who steps into one of these squares suffers the normal effects of coming into contact with caltrops (Core Rulebook 155). Once produced, these caltrops remain in existence until removed from their square, at which point they immediately disappear. The shoes can be used for 10 rounds per day. These rounds need not be consecutive.
