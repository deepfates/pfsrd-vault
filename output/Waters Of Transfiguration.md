Description: This small lacquered box made from exotic and colorful woods contains five vials and a single dropper. The vials are labeled "glass," "iron," "paper," "stone," and "wood," and each contains a magical fluid that permanently transforms solid objects it touches into that material. Administering the fluid requires the included dropper, is a standard action, and provokes an attack of opportunity (similar to drinking a potion, and the attacker can strike at the dropper instead of the bearer). For example, using the vial marked "paper" on a lock transforms the lock into paper, with all of the various properties of paper (hardness, hit points, flammability, and so on). If the target object has a volume of one cubic foot or less, the transformation occurs instantly. Larger objects slowly transform at a rate of 1 hour per cubic foot of material (maximum 10 cubic feet affected). Each vial contains 5 applications of that particular fluid. Magical and attended objects may resist this transformation with a successful DC 17 Fortitude save.
