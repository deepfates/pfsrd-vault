Name: [[Life Link Badge]]
Aura: strong conjuration
CL: 13
Slot: item
Price: 6,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: When this plain leather badge is sewn onto a [[summoner]]'s [[armor]] or clothing, a faded image of his [[summoner]] rune appears on its surface. The [[summoner]] can add charges to the badge by expending [[summoner]] spells slots; the badge gains charges equal to the spell level of the slot expended (maximum 5 charges). Adding charges to the badge is a standard action (regardless of the spell level expended). When the [[summoner]] uses his life link ability, instead of sacrificing his own hit points, he may expend charges from the badge to heal the [[eidolon]] 1d6 hit points per charge. The [[summoner]] does not have to decide how many charges are spent beforehand (he may expend one charge, roll, and decide whether or not to spend more charges for more healing). All charges in the badge are lost when the [[summoner]] readies spells after resting.
