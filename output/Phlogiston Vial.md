Name: [[Phlogiston Vial]]
Aura: moderate abjuration
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 3,300 gp
Weight: -
Description: This 1-inch-long, clear glass vial is filled with a dark, amber-colored fluid that resembles the twisting, flickering form of a fire elemental. The vial is sealed with a brass cap and attached to a lightweight gold chain. When the chain is wrapped around a divine caster's holy symbol, the saving throw DC of the next banishment or dismissal spell he casts on an outsider with the fire subtype is increased by 4, and additionally, the caster gains a +2 alchemical bonus on the caster level check to overcome the creature's spell resistance against the spell. If the spell is successful, the outsider leaves behind a small pile of magical ashes and the phlogiston vial cannot be used to banish outsiders again until the oil inside is replaced as a standard action (see below). If the ashes are collected and placed inside the vial, and the vial is used as an additional material component for a planar ally spell, the spell conjures the exact same outsider, provided the creature is a viable target of that spell. The owner of the vial receives a +4 bonus on her Charisma check to negotiate with the creature. The ashes are consumed after an agreement with the creature is made. A phlogiston vial is a single-use item that can be recharged with a rare alchemical agent called phlogiston oil, which can only be found on the Plane of Fire and costs 2,000 gp when sold on the open market. The listed price is for a phlogiston vial full of phlogiston oil.
