Name: [[Death Bill]]
Aura: moderate necromancy
CL: 10
Slot: item
Price: 14,318 gp
Weight: 10 lbs.
Description: Death bills are greatly coveted by redcaps, and the loss of a death bill is considered a great shame punishable by exile or even death. A death bill is a +1 scythe that leaves particularly unsightly wounds in its victims' flesh-these wounds do not bleed, and have dry, flaking edges, almost as if the wound had been desiccated by desert winds. Three times per day, the wielder of a death bill can swing the weapon as a standard action to create a scythe-shaped arc of dust that sweeps out from the user in a 30-foot cone. All creatures in this area take 2d4 points of slashing damage plus an amount of additional damage equal to the user's Charisma modifier, and are staggered for 1 round by the pain of having moisture drawn from their bodies by the supernatural effect. A successful DC 13 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the staggered effect. Once per day as a swift action, as a death bill is used to reduce a foe to negative hit points with a melee attack, the user may cast a death knell on that victim (Will DC 13 negates).
