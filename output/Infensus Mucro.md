Name: [[Infensus Mucro]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 4 lbs.
Description: This elegantly wrought +3 speed longsword remains pristine despite having been sheathed in a submerged corpse's chest cavity for over 200 years. Given to Bartolomae by an agent of [[Asmodeus]] in return for the warlord's (initially) secret allegiance to the arch fiend, this weapon carries within it the cruel soul of a long-dead high priest of [[Asmodeus]]. The weapon begins in a state of dormancy, at which point all of its intelligent weapon [[power]]s are unavailable, and it functions as nothing more than a +3 speed longsword. See the description of area L4 for details on how the sword can be awakened.
