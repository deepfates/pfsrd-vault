Description: This +1 kusarigama (Ultimate Combat 132) makes a shrill whistling sound whenever it is used in combat. Once per day as a standard action, the wielder of [[Dancing Wasp]] can whirl the weapon above his head as a full-round action to summon a giant wasp (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 275). The wasp appears in the air above the wielder's head and follows the wielder's mental commands to the best of its ability as long as the user continues to twirl the weapon (requiring a standard action each round), to a maximum of 5 rounds, after which the wasp vanishes.
