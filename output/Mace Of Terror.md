Name: [[Mace Of Terror]]
Aura: strong necromancy
CL: 13
Slot: item
Price: 38,552 gp
Weight: 8 lbs.
Description: This weapon usually appears to be a particularly frightening-looking iron or steel mace. On command, this +2 heavy mace causes the wielder's clothes and appearance to transform into an illusion of darkest horror, such that living creatures in a 30- foot cone become panicked as if by a fear spell (Will DC 16 partial). Those who fail this save take a -2 morale penalty on saving throws, and they flee from the wielder. The wielder may use this ability up to three times per day.
