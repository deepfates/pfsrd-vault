Description: When burned, this firework produces smoke as a smokestick. It also expands into a tube of ash that, after 1 round, takes the form of a thoqqua (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 262). The thoqqua attacks the user's opponents to the best of its ability. If the user speaks Ignan, she can direct the thoqqua to not attack, to attack particular enemies, or to perform other actions. After 5 rounds or when it is reduced to 0 hit points (whichever comes first), the thoqqua collapses into a pile of nonmagical ash.
