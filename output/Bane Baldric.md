Name: [[[[Bane]] Baldric]]
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 10
Slot: chest
Price: 10,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This ornate sash of embroidered velvet stretches across the chest from shoulder to waist. If the wearer is an [[inquisitor]], she is treated as five levels higher when using her bane and greater bane abilities. If the wearer is not an [[inquisitor]] she gains the bane ability of a 5th-level [[inquisitor]], but must first attune a light or one-handed melee weapon to the baldric by hanging it from the cloth for 24 hours, and can only use the bane ability with the attuned weapon. Attuning a new weapon to the baldric ends the attunement for the previous weapon.
