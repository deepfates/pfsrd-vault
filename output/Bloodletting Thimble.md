Description: This platinum thimble is intricately cast in the shape of an animal claw. When worn on the finger, the ring can be used to inflict a tiny wound as part of the use of a drain ability (use of the thimble in this way does not count as an action). This wound deals no additional damage but instead turns the target's pain to pleasure. The target must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or become fascinated, making no attempt to resist the draining that round or the following 2 rounds. At the end of this time, the creature's senses return and it may react accordingly.
