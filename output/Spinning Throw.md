name: [[Spinning Throw]]
type: Combat
description: You whirl your foe around and then let go.
prerequisites: Combat [[Expert]]ise, [[Improved Bull Rush]], [[Improved Trip]], [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Ki Throw]].
prerequisite_feats: Combat [[Expert]]ise, [[Improved Bull Rush]], [[Improved Trip]], [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Ki Throw]]
benefit: On a successful unarmed trip combat maneuver against an opponent your size or smaller, you can spend a swift action to attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against that opponent. If your bull rush succeeds, you can move that opponent to any unoccupied square you threaten, then push that opponent the number of 5-foot increments your successful bull rush allows. The target is then knocked prone. If the bull rush fails, you can use the [[Ki Throw]] feat as normal. If you also have the [[Improved [[Ki Throw]]]] feat, a successful bull rush allows you to push the opponent into a space secondary targets occupy. You [[resolve]] this effect as if you used the [[Improved [[Ki Throw]]]] feat to throw the opponent into that space.
