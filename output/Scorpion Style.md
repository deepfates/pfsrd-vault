name: [[Scorpion Style]]
type: Mythic
description: Your unarmed strikes can induce a near-crippling lethargy in your enemies.
prerequisites: [[Scorpion Style]].
prerequisite_feats: [[Scorpion Style]]
benefit: Whenever you are using [[Scorpion Style]], you add your tier to the number of rounds the target's base land speed is reduced. You can expend one use of mythic [[power]] when making your attack to slow your target, as the spell slow, unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modif ier). The slowing effect supersedes the normal speed penalty of your Scorpion Strike, but lasts for an equal number of rounds.
