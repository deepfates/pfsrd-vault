Name: [[Necklace Of [[Fireball]]s Type I]]V
Aura: moderate evocation
CL: 10
Slot: neck
Price: 5,400 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This item appears to be a string or cluster of spherical beads, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is-a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a fireball spell (Reflex DC 14 half). Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals. Each necklace of fireballs contains a combination of spheres of various strengths. Some traditional combinations, designated types I through VII, are detailed above. If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.
