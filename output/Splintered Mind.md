Name: [[Splintered Mind]]
Aura: moderate abjuration [chaotic, evil]
CL: 10
Slot: item
Price: 16,000 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: This lumpy gray and green slurry, made from the pureed brains of a dozen dretches, must be consumed as a full-round action in order to take effect, as this demonic cocktail invades and infuses the recipient's central nervous system, forming a mantle around every lobe, chiasm, and node of the recipient's brain. This mantle splinters the recipient's [[consciousness]] into dissociated and disorganized fragments linked only by this cortical mantle, making it more difficult for the recipient's mind to be compromised by outside influences. The splintered mind grants the recipient a +4 profane bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. Also, if the recipient is affected by any effect that is neither instantaneous nor permanent, it can attempt a new saving throw each round at the end of its turn to end the effect. The splintering of the recipient's mind is not without risk, nor is it a universal protection, as its benefits do not apply against effects that cause confusion or insanity. In addition, the recipient's disorganized thoughts impose a -2 penalty on initiative checks.
