Name: [[Everflowing Aspergillum]]
Aura: faint conjuration
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 7,805 gp
Weight: 4 lbs.
Description: The holy water in this +1 battle aspergillum never runs dry. However, the water vanishes 1 round after leaving the aspergillum, so it cannot be collected. As a full-round action, the wielder can swing the weapon to dispense a vial's worth of holy water as a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 10 feet and no range penalty. An everflowing aspergillum counts as a good-aligned weapon for purposes of overcoming damage reduction.
