Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 8,462 gp
Weight: 6 lbs.
Description: This magically strengthened bronze-tipped +1 spear enables its wielder to better face a variety of foes. Originally created by priests of [[Nethys]] for use by their temple guards, a spear of the watchful guardian also grants its wielder arcane aid to strike true. Once per day as a standard action, the wielder of a spear of the watchful guardian can alter the physical properties of the weapon, allowing it to bypass damage reduction of one of the following types: bludgeoning, cold iron, silver, or slashing. This change lasts for 5 minutes. In addition, if the wielder of a spear of the watchful guardian fails an attack roll, as an immediate action once per day, she can retroactively add a +1 competence bonus on that roll. If this bonus is enough to make the failure a success, the attack roll succeeds. Finally, a spear of the watchful guardian sharpens the senses of its wielder, granting her a +2 insight bonus on Perception checks.
