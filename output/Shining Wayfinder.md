Description: A shining wayfinder is a polished silver compass favored by members of the Shining Crusade. In addition to the usual functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create light), a shining wayfinder can be used to cast detect evil-when so used, its needle points not to the north but rather to the nearest source of evil within 60 feet. Once per day, a shining wayfinder can be used to cast protection from evil upon the wayfinder's bearer. A shining wayfinder functions only for a creature that is good-aligned. When held by an evil creature, the shining wayfinder's needle spins in a frantic circle. When held by any creature that is both nonevil and nongood, the needle simply hangs limply, not pointing to anything at all (not even to true north).
