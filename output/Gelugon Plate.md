Description: This midnight blue +3 Hellknight plateISWG is cold to the touch, and the fiendish faces that swirl across the plates shed gouts of chill mist. The wearer of this [[armor]] gains cold resistance 10. Any creature that ends its movement within 5 feet of the wearer must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw or be staggered for 1 round as the cold emitted by the [[armor]] numbs it. A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to the effects of that set of gelugon plate for 24 hours. The wearer of a set of gelugon plate can suppress and reactivate this effect as a standard action. A Hellknight (or Hellknight signifer with heavy [[armor]] proficiency) wearing this [[armor]] can cast wall of ice up to three times per day.
