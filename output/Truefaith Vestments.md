Name: [[Truefaith Vestments]]
Aura: moderate illusion
CL: 10
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 6,950 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Worn by enforcers and acolytes of the living god Razmir, this +1 chain shirt appears as a fine hooded robe made of silk of a color appropriate to the wearer's rank within the church as if it had the glamered special ability (it appears white when worn by anyone who doesn't follow Razmir). Used primarily as a means of appearing to be protected by the false god's [[power]], the [[armor]] is treated as a +3 breastplate against attacks made by any enemy who has not seen through the illusion. Unlike with standard glamered [[armor]], any creature that successfully hits the target with a melee weapon is considered to have interacted with the illusion, and can see the [[armor]]'s true form with a successful DC 16 Will save.
