CL: 7
Slot: shoulders
Price: 12,200 gp
Weight: 10 lbs.
Description: This silvery cloak has steel pauldrons built into it, and always seems to fit a little too loosely, no matter who happens to be wearing it. At the start of each day, the owner of a mantle of the protector may spend 10 minutes attuning the mantle to his [[armor]] and shield. He may then lend his attuned mantle to an ally, who can activate it as an immediate action at any time to gain the owner's [[armor]] and shield bonus as well as any other special properties the [[armor]] may have for 10 minutes. When the mantle is activated this way, the owner's [[armor]] and shield go dormant, and he loses any benefits they may provide for 1 minute.
