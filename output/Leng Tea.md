Description: By imbibing this potent concoction, a creature gains the ability to see as well as walk through the mysterious mountaintop portals that lead to the nightmare dimension of Leng. This effect lasts for 1d6 hours, during which time the drinker experiences phantasmagoric hallucinations in addition to the very real effect of seeing Leng's secret doorways. While in Leng, a creature under the effects of Leng tea can see the portal back to the Material Plane on the other side. As soon as the tea's effects end, the creature loses the ability to see gateways into or out of Leng, regardless of where the creature is. In addition, a creature coming down from the effects of Leng tea takes 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and is fatigued.
