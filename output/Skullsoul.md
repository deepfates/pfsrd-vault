Name: [[Skullsoul]]
Aura: strong necromancy
CL: 18
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 8 lbs.
Description: This grim, alabaster figurine is the size of a human skull with an elaborately sculpted base. The [[Skullsoul]] is inert until it is bonded with a living creature. It then becomes a [[power]]ful and never-questioning companion. The [[Skullsoul]] functions as a demilich (Bestiary 3 66) without the devour soul, rejuvenation, telekinetic storm, and torpor abilities, and with a hardness of 10. It is under the complete control of whoever bonds with the skull. Bonding with the [[Skullsoul]] is a ritual that takes 24 hours to perform, and doing so is an evil act. [[Paladin]]s and good [[cleric]]s who do so become ex-[[paladin]]s and ex-[[cleric]]s respectively. If they wish to atone, they must intercede with their deities (expending 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings) and must promise to contain the skull.
