Description: The perfect golden lute is [[sai]]d to be a flawless instrument; its tone and clarity are unrivaled. It is an instrument so fine it practically performs itself, granting anyone who plays it a +10 competency bonus on Perform (string instruments) checks with it. A character with ranks in Perform (string instrument) can play the lute to activate countersong, distraction, or fascinate (as the [[bard]]ic performance abilities) as if he were a 1st-level [[bard]], performing a number of rounds per day equal to his Charisma modifier. If the user of the perfect golden lute is a [[bard]], he adds +2 to the DC of all [[bard]]ic performance abilities using the lute, and can use [[bard]]ic performance with the lute for an additional 6 rounds per day.
