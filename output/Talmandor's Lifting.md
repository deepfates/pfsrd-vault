name: [[Talmandor's Lifting]]
type: Achievement
description: You felt the [[power]]ful wings of Talmandor surround you when you risked death from a fall, and somehow a tiny spark of his essence remains connected to your soul.
prerequisites: Take at least 10d6 falling damage on three different occasions and survive.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: When you cast a healing spell on an unharmed creature, it briefly manifests as a pair of wings made of golden light. The spell's duration becomes "1 hour or until discharged." For the next hour, the spell remains on the target, triggering automatically as a swift action if the creature takes damage or experiences an effect that the spell could cure, mitigate, or remove (which causes the wings of light to appear briefly). For example, if you cast lesser restoration on an ally who had no ability damage, the spell would trigger immediately if the target became fatigued, exhausted, or took ability damage, but not if the target suffered ability drain, energy drain, or hit point damage (none of which are affected by lesser restoration).
