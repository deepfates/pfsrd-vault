Name: [[Bottled Misfortune]]
Aura: moderate necromancy
CL: 10
Slot: item
Price: 500 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This leather bottle is filled to the brim with frothy green liquid. As a full-round action, a [[witch]] can target the bottle with any hex (but not a greater or grand hex) she knows that targets a single creature, transferring its effects to the brew within, which congeals into a sticky syrup. Any creature can use this syrup as a dose of injury poison (including the 5% chance to affect the user if she does not possess the poison use class feature). Any creature struck by a weapon coated in this syrup must save against the hex (DC 15) or be affected as if the [[witch]] had targeted them with the hex directly. The syrup counts as a poison and is a magical effect. If the hex cannot affect a target more than once every 24 hours, subsequent doses of the syrup are similarly ineffective against that target. Once imbued with the [[power]] of a hex, the syrup lasts for 24 hours before reverting into useless, harmless liquid.
