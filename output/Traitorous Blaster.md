Name: [[Traitorous Blaster]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 3
Slot: item
Price: 7,050 gp
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This +1 double-barreled pistol has an oversized stock to compensate for the massive recoil the weapon produces, though even with this attachment the kickback is strong enough to throw the pistol completely backward after firing. When both barrels of a traitorous blaster are loaded and the wielder is being flanked, the wielder can fire both barrels as a single action, with each shot targeting one of the enemies flanking the wielder. The wielder takes only a -2 penalty on these attack rolls (rather than the -4 penalty normally associated with firing both barrels of a double-barreled pistol as a single action).
