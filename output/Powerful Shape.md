benefit: You can apply the giant simple template (quick rules version, from Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 295) to any form you take with wild shape. This replaces the benefit from [[Powerful Shape]]. As a free action, you can expend one use of mythic [[power]] to combine the benefit from this feat with the benefit from non-mythic [[Powerful Shape]] for a number of rounds equal to your tier.
