Price: 0
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: The beacon of true faith takes the form of an ornate torch made of electrum. The torch holds an undying magical flame that requires no fuel or air, and in the hands of most creatures it simply functions as an everburning torch. When held by a divine spellcaster, an outsider with an alignment subtype, or a creature of especially strong religious faith (GM's discretion, but usually requiring a feat or trait reflecting this devotion), the beacon gains additional [[power]]s based on the bearer's alignment. All of these are command-word activated. Chaotic (violet flame): Word of chaos once per day on command. Good (white flame): Allies within 30 feet of the beacon gain the benefits of protection from evil and heroism. Evil (black flame): Bearer is constantly under the effect of protection from good and may use harm twice per day. Lawful (golden flame): [[Dictum]] once per day on command.
