Description: When a humanoid imbibes this foul-tasting green fluid, its ears grow to 10 times their size, and its head separates from its body. This effect is similar to beast shape II, shifting the drinker's [[consciousness]] into a Tiny form cosmetically similar to that of a chon chon, with the same [[power]]s of flight, constant detect magic sight, and +4 racial bonus on Perception checks made to listen, but lacking the creature's acid spit or jabber abilities. The duration of this transformation proves highly unpredictable, though. The GM should roll on the following chart to determine how long the effect lasts. d% Duration of [[Transformation]] 1 1 minute 2-25 1d10 minutes 26-50 6d10 minutes 51-75 1 hour 76-80 1d10 hours 81-85 6d10 hours 86-90 1 day 91-95 1d6 days 96-99 1 week 100 Permanent The transformation can be ended prematurely by remove curse-dispel magic has no effect. However, when the effect ends, the drinker's head immediately returns to normal. If the head is not within 5 feet of its body when the elixir's duration expires, the creature is slain immediately. The drinker knows when the elixir's effects will end 1 minute before they do so (no earlier). If the drinker's body is harmed or destroyed while its head is elsewhere, it takes that damage as soon as it reunites with its body, or is slain if its body has been destroyed. Until the elixir's duration ends, the drinker can only reattach its head to its body through the use of remove curse. The drinker's body is considered helpless while the head is unattached.
