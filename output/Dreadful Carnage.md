name: [[Dread]]ful Carnage
type: Mythic
description: Your kills are truly frightening to behold.
prerequisites: [[Dread]]ful CarnageAPG.
prerequisite_feats: [[Dread]]ful Carnage
benefit: When you use [[Dread]]ful Carnage, you affect non-mythic enemies within 60 feet in addition to all enemies within 30 feet. You can expend one use of mythic [[power]] before making the Intimidate check to cause enemies demoralized by [[Dread]]ful Carnage to become frightened instead of shaken, for the same duration as the normal shaken effect. While frightened by this ability, an enemy takes a penalty equal to your tier on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.
