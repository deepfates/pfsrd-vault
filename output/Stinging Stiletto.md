Description: This tiny dagger has a black leather hilt and a gold-inlaid pattern of stripes and sharp angles on its steel blade. It can transform into a delicate necklace or ornate finger-ring at the wearer's command. The wearer gains a +3 competence bonus on Perception checks while the item is carried or worn. The wearer can also use it to cast ghost sound once per day. If [[Calistria]] is the wearer's patron, once per day the wearer may speak a command word to use fox's cunning. As a standard action, the wearer can prick her finger with the dagger and swear an oath on her own blood to avenge herself against a particular named creature; the wearer gains a +1 competence bonus on her next attack roll within 1 minute against that creature. Speaking a new vengeance-oath removes the old one, whether or not the wearer has achieved her vengeance.
