Name: [[Burglar's Buckler]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: shield
Price: 4,655 gp
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This unassuming +1 buckler has an array of small tools and implements embedded into the backside of its rim, able to be folded and snapped out for use at a moment's notice to attack, defend, or accomplish roguish tasks. A burglar's buckler grants the wielder a +2 competence bonus on Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks, combat maneuver checks made to perform dirty tricks, and to CMD against dirty tricks. Once per day on command, the wielder may transform a burglar's buckler into any mundane tool weighing 1 to 5 pounds, such as a crowbar, hammer, saw, small shovel, grappling hook, artisan's tools, or thieves' tools. The burglar's buckler retains its normal hardness and hit points in this form and can be converted back into shield form on command.
