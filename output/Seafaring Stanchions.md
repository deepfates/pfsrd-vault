Slot: wrists
Price: 2,400 gp

Description: These unmarked bracers of oxidized steel slip easily onto the wrists. As a swift action while submerged underwater, the wearer can tap the bracers together, causing the bracers and any [[armor]] he wears to immediately be removed. Removed [[armor]] is disassembled, becomes incredibly buoyant, and floats to the surface. After 4 hours, if the items are still in the water, they lose their buoyancy and sink.
