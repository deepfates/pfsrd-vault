Name: [[Cat Burglar's Boots]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 3
Slot: feet
Price: 2,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: These soft-soled boots provide their wearer with a +2 competence bonus on [[Acrobatic]]s, Climb, and Stealth checks. Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer of cat burglar's boots can reroll any one failed [[Acrobatic]]s, Climb, or Stealth check, taking the result of that check in place of the first failed check (even if the second result is worse). In addition, a secret pocket in the boots is built to hold a fully functional set of masterwork thieves' tools. A DC 22 Perception check is required to notice this pocket. Any other object in the pocket causes it to bulge and become obvious to even casual observation.
