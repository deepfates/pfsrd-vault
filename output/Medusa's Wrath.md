name: [[Medusa's Wrath]]
type: Mythic
description: Your barrage of unarmed attacks builds to a single, staggering strike.
prerequisites: [[Medusa's Wrath]].
prerequisite_feats: [[Medusa's Wrath]]
benefit: You may forgo the two additional unarmed strikes of [[Medusa's Wrath]] to instead make a single unarmed strike at your highest base attack bonus. If you successfully hit your opponent, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier) or be staggered for 1 round. You can expend one use of mythic [[power]] when you stagger a target with [[Medusa's Wrath]] to extend the duration of the staggered condition by a number of rounds equal to half your tier.
