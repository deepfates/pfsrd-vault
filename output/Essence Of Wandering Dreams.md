Description: This minute crystal vial contains a single drop distilled from the captured dreams of a hundred different [[world]]s. The drop can be poured into a vessel of water, wine, or other drink, and shared between as many as nine recipients. If not drunk within an hour of mixing, it loses potency. The imbibers drift into sleep for at least 2d6 x 5 minutes (Will DC 17 negates). Anyone who sleeps for at least 2 hours receives a +2 insight bonus on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma-based skill checks for the next 24 hours. If an imbiber expends two uses of mythic [[power]] and envisions a destination as she falls asleep, she gains the benefits above and sleeps for 2 hours before waking on a plane of her choice as though using plane shift. Each imbiber who expends the uses of mythic [[power]] can travel to a different plane. All imbibers traveling to the same plane wake up at the same location on that plane.
