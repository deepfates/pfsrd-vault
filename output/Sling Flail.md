name: [[Sling Flail]]
type: Combat
description: You can use your loaded sling to effectively strike at nearby foes.
prerequisites: [[Weapon Focus]] (sling), base attack bonus +1.
prerequisite_feats: [[Weapon Focus]] (sling)
benefit: You can make melee attacks using your loaded sling, using that weapon's normal statistics but treating it as a flail. Using a sling in this way does not expend mundane ammunition, but magical or masterwork ammunition loses its special properties after a single hit.
normal: 0
special: Any feats you have that apply when you use a flail also apply when you use a loaded sling as a melee weapon.
