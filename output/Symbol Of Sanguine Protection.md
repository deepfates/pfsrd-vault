Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 6
Slot: neck
Price: 17,500 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This silver holy symbol rests just over the wearer's heart, imbuing his blood with divine [[power]]. After wearing the amulet for 24 hours, the wearer can shed his own blood as a standard action, dealing 1d6 points of damage to himself, to collect an amount of divinely em[[power]]ed blood that functions as a flask of holy water. The wearer can collect his blood this way once per day, but the individual vials lose their potency after just 1 week. [[Undead]] creatures and evil outsiders that successfully use a blood drain attack on the wearer take 4d6 points of positive energy damage and are sickened for 1d4 rounds unless they make a DC 16 Will save. Any benefit the creature might gain from drinking the wearer's blood is negated due to the [[power]] of this symbol.
