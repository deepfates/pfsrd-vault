name: [[Contingent Channeling]]
type: General
description: You can imbue others with your healing energy so that they can use it at the moment of greatest need.
prerequisites: True healer class feature, [[Selective Channeling]].
prerequisite_feats: [[Selective Channeling]]
benefit: You can use a standard action to touch an ally and expend one of your daily uses of channel energy to create a repository of positive energy within that ally. This repository contains the same number and type of dice as normal for your channel energy feature, and it lasts for 1 minute. An ally who has such a repository can use an immediate action to roll the repository's dice and regain a number of hit points equal to the result. If an ally who has such a repository is reduced to negative hit points, the repository triggers, allowing the ally to heal without using an action.
