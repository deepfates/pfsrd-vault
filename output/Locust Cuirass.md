Name: [[Locust Cuirass]]
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 6
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 6,565 gp
Weight: 8 lbs.
Description: The overlapping leather plates of this +2 lamellar cuirass (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 12) oddly feel more like insect chitin than the supple leather they are crafted from. This [[armor]]'s lightweight construction gives it a maximum Dexterity bonus of +6. The wearer of a locust cuirass can take 10 on [[Acrobatic]]s checks to jump even if distracted or in danger. Once per day as an immediate action, the wearer can summon a swarm of locusts that surround her and support her weight during a fall, causing her to drift slowly down to the ground, similar to feather fall. While falling, the wearer can move up to 5 feet in any horizontal direction for every 1 foot she falls, at a speed of 60 feet per round. The wearer takes no damage upon landing. The effect ends as soon as the wearer touches the ground or after 6 rounds, whichever comes first. If the effect expires while the wearer is still in the air, she falls the remaining distance as normal.
