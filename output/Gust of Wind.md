description: This spell creates a severe blast of air (approximately 50 mph) that originates from you, affecting all creatures in its path. All flying creatures in this area take a -4 penalty on [[Fly]] skill checks. Tiny or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 25 [[Fly]] skill check or be blown back 2d6 x 10 feet and take 2d6 points of damage. Small or smaller flying creatures must make a DC 20 [[Fly]] skill check to move against the force of the wind.  A Tiny or smaller creature on the ground is knocked down and rolled 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet.  Small creatures are knocked prone by the force of the wind.  [[Medium]] or smaller creatures are unable to move forward against the force of the wind unless they succeed at a DC 15 Strength check.  Large or larger creatures may move normally within a gust of wind effect.  This spell can't move a creature beyond the limit of it's range.  Any creature, regardless of size, takes a -4 penalty on ranged attacks and Perception checks in the area of a gust of wind.  The force of the gust automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those in lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50% chance to extinguish those lights.  In addition to the effects noted, a gust of wind can do anything that a sudden blast of wind would be expected to do. It can create a stinging spray of sand or dust, fan a large fire, overturn delicate awnings or hangings, heel over a small boat, and blow gases or vapors to the edge of its range.  Gust of wind can be made permanent with a permanency spell.
