Name: [[[[Jump]]ing Cinder]]
Aura: faint evocation
CL: 3
Slot: item
Price: 300 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This piece of sooty coal has a tiny bit of flint embedded in it. The bearer of a jumping cinder can, as a standard action, order it to burst into flames and bounce around in random directions. Each round, the jumping cinder leaps into a randomly selected adjacent square. If a creature is in the square into which the jumping cinder lands, that creature takes 1d6 points of fire damage if it fails a DC 12 Reflex save. After 1 minute, the jumping cinder burns out, leaving behind a puff of smoke and a tiny smear of ash. Some goblin tribes use jumping cinders to randomly select volunteers for undesirable duties from a large crowd of goblins-anyone who takes fire damage from the jumping cinder but is not killed by the fire has to do the undesirable task.
