name: [[Gun Twirling]]
type: General
description: You can spin and juggle a small firearm, making it difficult to predict where you will shoot.
prerequisites: [[Amateur [[Gunslinger]]]]UC feat or grit class feature, [[Dazzling Display]], [[Weapon Focus]].
prerequisite_feats: [[Dazzling Display]], [[Weapon Focus]]
benefit: You can spend 1 grit point to make a feint attempt using a one-handed firearm for which you have [[Weapon Focus]] (instead of a melee weapon).

If you have the [[Quick Draw]] feat, you can holster a onehanded firearm as a free action as long as you have at least 1 grit point.
