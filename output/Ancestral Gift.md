It has a +1 enhancement bonus and one weapon special ability (your choice) from the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook with a price equivalent to a +1 bonus (if the weapon is a double weapon, the ability and the enhancement bonus only apply to one end, or the weapon can have a +1 enhancement bonus on both ends but no other magical abilities).
