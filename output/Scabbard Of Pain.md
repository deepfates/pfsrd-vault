Name: Scab[[bard]] Of Pain
Aura: faint necromancy
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 2,500 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This rugged black leather scab[[bard]] is wrapped in jet black chains that allow it to easily be hung from one's belt. A scab[[bard]] of pain grants it bearer knowledge of advanced torturing techniques used by depraved cultists of the Midnight Lord. It grows or shrinks to fit any bladed weapon sized for a [[Medium]] or Small creature. Three times per day, the bearer can declare that he is attempting to deliver a painful strike with a melee attack. If the attack hits, the opponent must succeed at a DC 11 Fortitude save or be affected by ray of sickeningUM. The bearer can expend one use of the scab[[bard]]'s painful strike as an immediate action to affect himself with the ray of sickening effect and voluntarily fail the saving throw. Doing so allows the bearer to reroll a failed saving throw against a mind-affecting effect.
