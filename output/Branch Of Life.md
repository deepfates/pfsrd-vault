Aura: strong conjuration
CL: 15
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This verdant branch glows with a soothing, pale green light. Carefully pruned from the [[world]]'s first tree, this artifact hums with energy. Full of everlasting life, it needs time to transfer its magic. It can cast heal at will, but needs a full hour to do so. Once a day, it can cast resurrection, but it takes the full day to do so. The branch serves only those who are worthy. It will not stay in the possession of a non-good creature for long, disappearing in 1d4 days. It will similarly disappear while in the possession of a good creature who associates with nongood creatures, but this takes 2d8 days to occur.
