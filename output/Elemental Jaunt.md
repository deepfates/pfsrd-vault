description: The [[spirits]] of your ancestral home call to you, beckoning you to return.
prerequisites: Character level 15th, ifrit, oread, sylph, or undine.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: Once per day, you can cast plane shift as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your level to transport yourself and willing targets to an elemental plane that is appropriate to your race (ifrits to the Plane of Fire, oreads to the Plane of Earth, sylphs to the Plane of Air, and undines to the Plane of Water). While on that plane, you (but not anyone transported with you) are treated as though under the effect of the spell planar adaptation (Advanced Player's Guide 236).
