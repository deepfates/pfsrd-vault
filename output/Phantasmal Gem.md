Name: [[Phantasmal Gem]]
Aura: faint illusion
CL: 3
Slot: item
Price: 4,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This small cut crystal appears to be filled with hazy, indistinct images that constantly shift and vary. If a spellcaster holding the phantasmal gem casts an illusion spell with a duration of concentration (or concentration + a number of rounds), the illusion lasts up to an additional 10 rounds after the spellcaster ceases concentrating on it. The spellcaster may end the illusion early as a swift action. The phantasmal gem can be used multiple times in a day, but cannot grant more than a total of 10 additional rounds of illusion spells per day. A gnome using a phantasmal gem can recharge it by expending uses of spell-like abilities gained through the gnome magic racial trait. Each spell-like ability expended as a standard action recharges 1 round of duration to the phantasmal gem (up to a maximum of 10 rounds).
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], creator must be a gnome or a [[wizard]] specialized in the school of illusion
