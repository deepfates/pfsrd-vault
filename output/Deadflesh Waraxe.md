Name: [[Deadflesh Waraxe]]
Aura: strong conjuration and transmutation
CL: 12
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 8 lbs.
Description: These +1 mithral ghost touch undead bane dwarven waraxes were crafted hurriedly to combat the rising undead threat, but the rush to craft these weapons and cut corners in their creation resulted in a dangerous flaw-whenever an undead creature is slain with a deadflesh waraxe, the axe allows a portion of the destroyed undead's necromantic energy to flow through the axe and into the wielder's body, causing the wielder to become shaken for 1 minute if he fails a DC 15 Will save. These effects stack with each other-the second time the victim succumbs, he becomes frightened. The third time, he is panicked and drops the deadflesh waraxe in his attempt to flee. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. This flaw is relatively subtle-in order to notice it when identifying the item, the examiner must exceed the DC 27 Spellcraft check by 10 points or more. In the hands of a soldier ready to deal with this imperfection, a deadflesh waraxe can be a [[power]]ful tool against the undead, but many of the dwarven defenders of the mines weren't made aware of the flaw until it was too late.
