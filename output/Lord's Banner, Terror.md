Name: [[Lord's Banner, Terror]]
Aura: moderate (various schools)
CL: 10
Slot: item
Price: 56,000 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: A lord's banner is a cloth flag or standard, typically at least 2 feet wide and 4 feet long (though some are up to twice that size), meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when laying on the ground. It normally depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of a particular noble. A lord's banner may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the banner does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner. Terror: Enemies of the bearer of a lord's banner of terror, while within 30 feet and able to see the banner, must make a Will saving throw (DC 16) or become panicked, fleeing as quickly as possible for as long as they can see the banner. Those that succeed on the save are shaken. A creature that makes its saving throw is immune to the banner's effects for 1 day.
