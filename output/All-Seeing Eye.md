Name: [[All-Seeing Eye]]
Aura: moderate divination
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 5,500 gp
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This hardened, oversized eyeball is nearly a foot in diameter. The possessor gains a +1 insight bonus on the saving throw DCs of any spells of the divination school he casts, as well as a +1 insight bonus on dispel checks made against divination effects. In addition, once per week, the possessor of an all-seeing eye can cast commune as a spell-like ability without the need for a material component. Using an all-seeing eye in this way effectively uses up its magic for a week, and the possessor does not benefit from the insight bonuses it grants until a week after commune was cast.
