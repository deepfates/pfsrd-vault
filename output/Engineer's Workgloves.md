Description: These durable canvas and leather gloves imbue the wearer with an instinctive knowledge of mechanical devices. The wearer also gains a +5 competence bonus on Craft and Knowledge checks made to repair or understand mechanical devices. Once per day, the wearer may touch a device and instantly analyze it, learning its purpose and general method of operation, as well as diagnosing any acute malfunctions of the device, but not its magical [[power]]s or additional non-mechanical effects. For example, she could touch a pressure plate and understand that stepping on it would trigger a wall scythe trap attacking that square and that the trap resets automatically, but not that the trap includes a +1 flaming scythe coated in poison.
