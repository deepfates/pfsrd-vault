Name: [[Rod Of Thunder And [[Light]]ning]]
Aura: moderate evocation
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 33,000 gp
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: [[Construct]]ed of iron set with silver rivets, this rod has the properties of a +2 light mace. Its other [[power]]s are as follows. • [[Light]]ning: Once per day, when the wielder desires, a short spark of electricity can leap forth when the rod strikes an opponent to deal the normal damage for a +2 light mace (1d6+2) and an extra 2d6 points of electricity damage. Even when the rod fails to score a normal hit in combat, if the roll was good enough to count as a successful melee touch attack, then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still apply. The wielder activates this [[power]] as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent within 1 round. • [[Light]]ning Stroke: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide lightning bolt dealing 9 d6 points o f electricity damage (Reflex DC 16 half) to a range of 200 feet. • Thunder: Once per day, the rod can strike as a +3 light mace, and the opponent struck is stunned from the noise of the rod's impact (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this sonic [[power]] counts as a free action, and it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round. • Thunderclap: Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause the rod to give out a deafening noise, just as a shout spell (Fortitude DC 16 partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target deafened for 2d6 rounds). • Thunder and [[Light]]ning: Once per week as a standard action, the wielder of the rod can combine the thunderclap [[power]] with a lightning bolt, as in the lightning stroke [[power]]. The thunderclap affects all creatures within 10 feet of the bolt. The lightning stroke deals 9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the thunderclap deals 2d6 points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save applies for both effects.
