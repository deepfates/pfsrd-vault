Aura: faint necromancy
CL: 5
Slot: neck
Price: 3,500 gp
Weight: -
Description: This medallion hangs on a leather cord, a silver disc inscribed with the [[Sihedron]]. These medallions were given to favored agents of the runelords; the medallions granted some minor benefits to the wearers, but also allowed the runelords to use the wearer as proxies. By concentrating on a scrying device (such as a runewell), a runelord can sense the [[world]] through the [[Sihedron]] medallion wearer's senses, and could speak through her voice-provided the runelord knows of the existence of the medallion and the fact that it is being worn. Thus, Karzoug cannot use the medallion while it's worn by Nualia in Chapter One, as she is unknown to him, but once the PCs come to his attention later in the campaign, that may well change. See page 324 for more details on the ramifications of wearing a [[Sihedron]] medallion in Xin-Shalast. While worn, a [[Sihedron]] medallion grants its wearer a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. Once per day, as a free action, it may be commanded to bestow the effects of false life on the wearer. Placed on the neck of a dead body, a [[Sihedron]] medallion preserves the body indefinitely via a gentle repose effect.
