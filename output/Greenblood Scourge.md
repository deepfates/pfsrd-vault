Name: [[Greenblood Scourge]]
Aura: moderate evocation
CL: 12
Slot: item
Price: 13,801 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: Originally made from the winding intestines of a scrag, the first version of this +2 corrosiveUE whip was crafted by a blood-[[bard]] who fought in Green Blood on a Black Rock. After the blood-[[bard]]'s stunning victory, these weapons have gained popularity across the Sodden Lands and [[Shackles]]. Unless damaged by fire, a greenblood scourge regenerates hit points at a rate of 1 hit point per minute. In performance combat (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 153), the wielder of a greenblood scourge can spend a victory point as a swift action to give the weapon the corrosive burstUE special ability. Also, the wielder no longer needs to attempt a performance combat check when using the withdraw action during performance combat, as the weapon's blasts of acid prevent the enemy from approaching.
