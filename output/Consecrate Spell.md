name: [[[[Consecrate]] Spell]]
type: Metamagic
description: You infuse spells with heavenly [[power]], drastically increasing their effectiveness against would-be heralds of evil.
prerequisites: Aasimar, able to prepare or cast consecrate.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: A consecrated spell is treated as a maximized spell against evil creatures and creatures with the evil subtype. Against all other creatures, this feat does not modify the spell in any way (for example, a consecrated fireball acts as a normal fireball against neutral or good creatures). This feat does not stack with [[Maximize Spell]]. A consecrated spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.
