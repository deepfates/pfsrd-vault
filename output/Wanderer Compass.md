Name: [[Wanderer Compass]]
Aura: moderate divination
CL: 6
Slot: item
Price: 18,000 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This brass compass's needle appears to be of a weird material, one that shimmers silver and blue. When held in hand in a magic-warped region such as the Mana Wastes, a wanderer compass points toward the nearest pocket of magical non-interference-an area where there is little or no chance of spellcasting being warped by primal magic. This effect has a range of 1 mile. If no pockets of non-interference are within range, the compass's needle slowly spins clockwise. If the bearer of a wanderer compass is already within a pocket of non-interference, the compass needle spins counter-clockwise.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], [[Enlarge Spell]], arcane sight, clairaudience/clairvoyance
