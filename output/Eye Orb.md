Name: [[Eye Orb]]
Aura: moderate divination
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 80,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: If a blind creature holds this orb, that creature can see with darkvision with a range of 120 feet, but also gains light sensitivity (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 301). If a sighted creature holds this orb and holds his eyes shut for 1 minute, he gains the blinded condition until he opens his eyes (as a free action), but can see through the orb as if he were a blind creature. By expending one use of mythic [[power]], a creature using the eye orb can see as though using true seeing, and loses light sensitivity. These effects last for 1 minute or until he stops using the orb to see, whichever comes first.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], [[Mythic Crafter]], darkvision, true seeing
