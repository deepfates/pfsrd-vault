Name: [[Breastplate Of [[Command]]]]
Aura: strong enchantment
CL: 15
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 25,400 gp
Weight: 30 lbs.
Description: This +2 breastplate typically bears the image of a rampant grizzly bear or other impressive predator. It bestows a commanding aura upon its wearer. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on all Charisma checks, including Charisma-based skill checks. The wearer also gains a +2 competence bonus to his [[Leadership]] score. Friendly troops within 360 feet of the user become braver than normal, gaining a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against fear. Since the effect arises in great part from the distinctiveness of the [[armor]], it does not function if the wearer hides or conceals herself in any way.
