Name: [[[[Sihedron]] Tome]]
Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 16
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: The first [[[[Sihedron]] Tome]]s were [[sai]]d to have been crafted by a dragon in the service of Emperor Xin. Each of these books has a [[unique]] appearance, and hold an infinite number of pages for spellcasters to inscribe spells upon. Any [[wizard]] who prepares spells from a [[[[Sihedron]] Tome]], which potentially holds libraries worth of arcane knowledge, may prepare bonus spells as if her Intelligence were 6 points higher. This is not an actual bonus to Intelligence and grants the user no additional benefit. Karzoug's [[[[Sihedron]] Tome]] contains all [[sorcerer]]/[[wizard]] spells (save for those of the schools of Enchantment and Illusion) found in the Core Rulebook and this book-at the GM's discretion, it can certainly hold more spells.
