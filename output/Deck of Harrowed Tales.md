Description: The [[Deck of [[Harrowed]] Tales]] is a [[unique]] harrow deck linked to the [[Harrowed]] Realm. Creatures within the [[Harrowed]] Realm peering through the outreaching eye (see page 30) can view, hear, and speak with the deck's wielder. The outreaching eye allows the observer to cast dominate person once per day on the deck's wielder. Once per day, at a mental command from its wielder, the [[Deck of [[Harrowed]] Tales]] can create a swirling vortex to the [[Harrowed]] Realm, as per the spell gate. This ability does not function while the deck is on the [[Harrowed]] Realm.
