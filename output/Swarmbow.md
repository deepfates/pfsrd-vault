Name: [[Swarmbow]]
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 6
Slot: weapon
Price: 11,275 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This +2 composite shortbow is carved of withered juniper wood to resemble a swarming mass of wasps. Favored by the mystical bee-people called the thriae, a swarmbow has a considerable draw, requiring a minimum Strength modifier of +5 to use it without penalty. Once per day on a successful strike with an arrow fired from a swarmbow, the wielder can cause a wasp swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 275) to appear around the target of the attack as an immediate action. The swarm attacks any creatures occupying its area, but remains stationary and does not pursue fleeing creatures. The wasp swarm remains for 1d4+2 rounds or until destroyed.
