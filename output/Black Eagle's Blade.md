Description: This +1 greatsword is made of blackened steel and embodies the Lambreth ideal that all crimes must be punished twice. Once per day after the wielder slays a creature with the Black Eagle's blade, the wielder can em[[power]] the weapon to become a +2 bane greatsword as an immediate action; the sword's bane ability is keyed to the same creature type as the one that the wielder killed to activate the effect. This effect lasts for 8 rounds or until the wielder kills a second creature with the weapon, whichever comes first.
