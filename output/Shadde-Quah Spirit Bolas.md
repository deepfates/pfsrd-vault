Description: Primarily used by the cliff-dwelling Shoanti of western [[Varisia]]'s Shadde-Quah clan, a +1 Shoanti bolasISWG is elementally enchanted. Each end of a bolas has its own magical enhancements: one side bears cold magic, and the other bears fire magic. A target damaged by a Shadde-Quah spirit bolas takes an additional 1d3 points of cold damage and 1d3 points of fire damage, as the two weights damage their target as though the weapon had both the flaming and frost special weapon abilities at half their normal effectiveness. Once per day as a standard action, the wielder of a Shadde-Quah spirit bolas can utter a prayer to the elements and throw the bolas, causing both ends to crash together mid-flight. The bolas transforms into a roiling ball of water, as the spell aqueous orb (Advanced Player's Guide 202), under the control of the thrower. Once the spell ends, the bolas falls to the ground at the same location the orb ended its movement.
