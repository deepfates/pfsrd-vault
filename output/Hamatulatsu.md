name: [[Hamatulatsu]]
type: Combat
description: You have mastered a deadly fighting form inspired by the hideous attacks of the barbed devil.
prerequisites: [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Weapon Focus]] (unarmed strike).
prerequisite_feats: [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Weapon Focus]] (unarmed strike)
benefit: Your unarmed attacks can deal either bludgeoning or piercing damage. You decide which type of damage you deal whenever you attack a foe, but you may only choose one type at a time. If you critically hit a foe with your unarmed strike while doing piercing damage, the additional pain caused by the strike causes the foe to become sickened for 1 round (or staggered for 1 round if the target is already sickened). Multiple critical hits in a round against a single foe do not increase the duration of the sickened or staggered condition.
normal: 0
special: [[Hamatulatsu]] may be selected as a substitute bonus feat at 6th level by a [[monk]] even if the [[monk]] does not otherwise meet the prerequisites. This fighting style is normally only taught to women of the Sisterhood of the Golden Erinyes.
