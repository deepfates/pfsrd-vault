Description: Appearing to be a finely crafted bridle of polished steel and blue-dyed leather, a bridle of tricks can be placed on any animal or magical beast with an appropriate shape to wear a bridle (creatures with unusual anatomies may be affected with GM discretion). While wearing the bridle, a creature is treated as knowing three, four, or five additional tricks, as if it had been taught the tricks with the Handle [[Animal]] skill. The tricks granted by a bridle of tricks are set when it is created, and cannot be changed. The most common tricks found in a bridle of tricks are attack, defend, fetch, guard, and heel. See the Handle [[Animal]] description on page 97 of the Core Rulebook for more information on tricks, and Pathfinder Player Companion: [[Animal]] Archive for new additional tricks.
