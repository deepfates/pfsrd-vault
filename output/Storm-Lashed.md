benefit: You can ignore many of the effects of severe weather. In rainy conditions, your visibility is only reduced by one-quarter (not by half ) and you only take a -2 penalty on Perception checks. You are treated as if you were one size category larger for the purpose of wind effects, and halve any penalty to Perception caused by high winds. Finally, you gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws against electrical effects.
