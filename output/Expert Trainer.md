name: [[Expert]] Trainer
type: General
description: You have a special knack for a certain profession and take to it with ease.
prerequisites: 0
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: Choose three character classes. For the purposes of retraining, you are always considered to have a retraining synergy with these classes, regardless of your current class. Additionally, retraining any class option takes you half the time it normally would (and thus half the gp cost), though retraining a class still takes the normal amount of time (5 days for a class with which you have synergy, 7 for a class with which you don't). If you take this feat via retraining or replace it with another feat in the same manner, the retraining time takes twice as long as normal in regards to this feat only.
