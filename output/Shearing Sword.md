Name: [[Shearing Sword]]
Aura: moderate evocation
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 8,350 gp
Weight: 8 lbs.
Description: This +1 greatsword is often found among the robot-hunters of [[Numeria]]. Three times per day as a standard action, the wielder can envelop the blade with a razor-edged field of force for 1 minute. Thanks to this field, the sword ignores the damage reduction of creatures with DR 5 or less (other than DR/epic), and when it's used to attack an object or sunder a weapon, the sword treats the item as having a hardness of 5 less than the item's actual hardness.
