Name: [[Figurine Of Wondrous Power (obsidian raven)]]
Aura: moderate conjuration and transmutation
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 15,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This figurine of wondrous [[power]] is similar to a silver raven, but it can be used to send messages across the planes. On command, the figurine turns into a raven (retaining its stone-like consistency, which gives it hardness 8). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message as the sending spell (with no chance of the message not arriving). The recipient of the message can then use the obsidian raven to plane shift (self only) to the plane from which the message was sent. The figurine can be used in this way once per day. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special abilities, and it can maintain its non-figurine status for 24 hours per week (the duration need not be continuous).
