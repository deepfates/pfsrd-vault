name: [[Dragon]] Roar
type: Combat
description: The spirit of the dragon wells up inside you and bursts forth in a mighty roar.
prerequisites: Str 15, [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Dragon]] Style, [[Stunning Fist]], [[Acrobatic]]s 8 ranks.
prerequisite_feats: [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Dragon]] Style, [[Stunning Fist]]
benefit: You gain one additional [[Stunning Fist]] attempt per day. While using [[Dragon]] Style, as a standard action you can expend two [[Stunning Fist]] attempts to unleash a concussive roar in a 15-foot cone. Creatures caught in the cone take your unarmed strike damage and become shaken for 1d4 rounds. A successful Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being shaken.
normal: 0
special: If you have the [[Elemental Fist]] feat (Advanced Player's Guide 158), you can expend a daily use of that feat to deal your [[Elemental Fist]] damage to those caught in the cone. This damage is not halved even on a save.
