Name: [[Pauldrons Of The Watchful Lion]]
Aura: faint necromancy
CL: 5
Slot: shoulders
Price: 10,800 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: These steel and brass pauldrons feature two brass lion heads, one on each shoulder. Twice a day as an immediate action when a creature successfully makes an [[Acrobatic]]s check to move through the wearer's threatened area or its space without provoking an attack of opportunity, a shadowy lion can animate from one of the pauldrons and attack that creature. The attack uses the wearer's base attack bonus + Dexterity modifier and attacks the target's touch AC. On a hit, the lion deals 2d6 points of piercing damage (x2 critical).
