Name: [[Mask Of The Skull]]
Aura: strong necromancy and transmutation
CL: 13
Slot: head
Price: 22,000 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: This fearsome-looking mask of ivory, beaten copper, or pale wood is typically fashioned into the likeness of a human skull with a missing lower jaw, allowing the bottom half of the wearer's face to remain visible when the mask is worn. Once per day, after it has been worn for at least 1 hour, the mask can be loosed to fly from the wearer's face. It travels up to 50 feet away from the wearer and attacks a target assigned to it. The grinning skull mask makes a touch attack against the target based on the wearer's base attack bonus. If the attack succeeds, the target must make a successful DC 20 Fortitude save or take 130 points of damage, as if affected by a finger of death spell. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, it nevertheless takes 3d6+13 points of damage. After attacking (whether successful or not), the mask flies back to its user. The mask has AC 16, 10 hit points, and hardness 6.
