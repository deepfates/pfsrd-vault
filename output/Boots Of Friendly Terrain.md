Name: [[Boots Of Friendly Terrain]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: feet
Price: 2,400 gp

Description: Boots of friendly terrain turn inhospitable territory into a perfect hunting grounds for any [[ranger]] who wears them, so much so that his footprints vanish behind him with each step he takes. Each pair of these supple leather boots corresponds to a specific sort of environment as defined by the [[ranger]]'s favored terrain class feature (jungles, plains, and so on). A [[ranger]] wearing the boots can treat the corresponding environment of the boots as one of his favored terrains, granting him a +2 bonus. If he already has that particular environment as one of his favored terrains, that terrain's bonus increases by 2.
