Name: [[Pipes Of Pain]]
Aura: moderate enchantment
CL: 6
Slot: item
Price: 12,000 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: By making a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the bearer can use these pipes to create a wondrous melody which fascinates creatures within 30 feet for as long as the bearer continues to play (Will DC 14 negates). This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion effect. The bearer is immune to the sound of the pipes. When the bearer stops playing, for the next 2d4 rounds all creatures who were fascinated by the music are stricken by intense pain at even the slightest noise. Unless a creature is in a totally silent area, it takes 1d4 points of damage per round on its turn, and it has sonic vulnerability until this time expires. Thereafter, the creature is shaken unless it is in a totally silent area; this hypersensitivity to noise is a curse effect.
