Name: Vambraces Of The [[Tactician]]
Aura: moderate enchantment
CL: 7
Slot: wrists
Price: 8,000 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: These vambraces change their appearance depending on who wears them. If the wearer is a [[cavalier]], these vambraces display the symbol of his order. When unworn or in the hands of a non-[[cavalier]], they appear to be an ordinary pair of steel vambraces. A [[cavalier]] wearing these vambraces is considered two class levels higher for purposes of determining the effects of his challenge class feature. Furthermore, once per day as a swift action, a [[cavalier]] with the tactician class feature can increase the area in which he grants teamwork feats. Before the end of his next turn, when the [[cavalier]] grants his allies a teamwork feat, he can grant it to all allies within 60 feet, though they must still be able to see and hear him.
