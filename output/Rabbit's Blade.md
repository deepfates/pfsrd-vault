Name: [[Rabbit's Blade]]
Aura: moderate evocation
CL: 7
Slot: item
Price: 22,307 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: The blade of this unassuming longsword is permanently broken, snapped at an angle halfway along the blade. In spite of this, the sword can be wielded as a +2 [[short sword]] without penalty. As long as the wielder of a rabbit's blade is threatening two or more foes and he has no allies within 15 feet, he gains the use of the [[Cleave]] feat. If he is threatening three or more foes and has no allies within 30 feet, the wielder gains the use of the Great [[Cleave]] feat instead. Each threatened foe must have Hit Dice equal to or greater than 1/2 the wielder's character level in order to count toward this weapon's ability.
Requirements: [[Cleave]], Craft Magical Arms and Armor, Great [[Cleave]], divine [[power]]
