name: [[Versatile Channeler]]
type: General
description: You can choose to channel positive and negative energy.
prerequisites: Channel energy class feature, necromancer or neutrally aligned [[cleric]] (see below).
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: You may make a choice whenever you use your channel energy class feature. If you normally channel positive energy, you may choose to channel negative energy as if your effective [[cleric]] level were 2 levels lower than normal. If you normally channel negative energy, you may choose to channel positive energy as if your effective [[cleric]] level were 2 levels lower than normal. Having this feat means you qualify for feats and abilities that have "channel positive energy" or "channel negative energy" as a prerequisite (for example, you qualify for the [[Command]] [[Undead]] feat and the Turn [[Undead]] feat).

[[Cleric]]s whose alignment or deity makes this choice for them cannot select this feat.
