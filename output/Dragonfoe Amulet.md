Name: [[Dragon]]foe Amulet
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 9
Slot: neck
Price: 20,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This amulet consists of a cracked dragon scale set in a disk of gold. Most are slightly damaged, bearing the scars of draconic breath weapons. The dragonfoe amulet is a [[power]]ful, specialized tool for those who oppose dragons, improving the protection and attacks of the wearer in a number of ways. The wearer of a dragonfoe amulet ignores the damage reduction of dragons. This only affects actual dragons, not all creatures of the dragon type. In addition, if the wearer casts a spell against a dragon, she can roll twice to overcome any spell resistance the dragon might possess, taking the higher result. Lastly, the wearer takes no damage instead of half damage on a successful Reflex save against a dragon's breath weapon (as the evasion ability).
