Name: [[Iron Lord's Transforming Slivers]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 1,000 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: The metal filings within this pouch are a mixture of adamantine, cold iron, mithral, and steel. The filings are faintly magnetic and stick to ferrous metal but are easily wiped away. If a metal or partly metal weapon is covered in the entire contents of the pouch and placed in a hot forge overnight, it slowly grows or shrinks by one size category toward the size of the creature who applied the powder. For example, a Small +1 longsword coated with the filings by a [[Medium]] creature transforms into a [[Medium]] +1 longsword. This transformation is permanent. The pouch contains enough material to transform one weapon, regardless of size.
