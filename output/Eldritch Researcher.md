goal: Create a new spell of at least 6th level.
completion_benefit: The save DCs for any spells you create increase by 1 when you cast them. In addition, when applying metamagic feats to self-created spells, reduce the total level adjustment by 1. You can't reduce metamagic costs to lower than the spell's original level in this manner. Special: For a self-created spell to benef it from this feat, it must be a truly novel spell. Spells slightly altered from the original (for example, delayed blast fireball as compared to fireball) gain no benef it. [[Alchemist]]s can benef it from this feat as though their formulae and extracts were spells.
