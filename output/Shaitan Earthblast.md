type: Combat
description: With a forceful stomp you release a blast of acid from the earth to burn your enemies.
prerequisites: Con 15, Wis 17, [[Elemental Fist]]**, [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Shaitan Skin]], [[Shaitan Style]], base attack bonus +13 or [[monk]] level 11th.
prerequisite_feats: [[Elemental Fist]], [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Shaitan Skin]], [[Shaitan Style]]
benefit: While using the [[Shaitan Style]] feat, as a standard action, you can spend two [[Elemental Fist]] (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempts to unleash a 20-foot column of acid that has a 5-foot radius and erupts from a point of origin within 30 feet of you. Creatures caught in the column take your unarmed strike damage plus the acid damage from your [[Elemental Fist]] and are staggered for 1 round. A successful Ref lex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modif ier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from being staggered.
