Name: [[Mosswater Stained Leather]]
Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 14
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 11,575 gp
Weight: 20 lbs.
Description: This set of +2 studded leather glows eerily in darkness. Tinted using rare dyes from the lost town of Mosswater in the River Kingdoms, this leather suit gives its wearer a ghostly appearance in areas of dim light or darker. While in such areas, the wearer gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff checks to pretend to be undead. On command, the [[armor]] makes its wearer ethereal (as the ethereal jaunt spell). The effect is dismissible. The [[armor]] can be used in this manner for a total of up to 10 rounds per day. This duration doesn't need to be continuous, but must be used in 1-round increments.
