name: [[Selective Spell]]
type: Metamagic
description: Your allies need not fear friendly fire.
prerequisites: Spellcraft 10 ranks.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: When casting a selective spell with an area effect and a duration of instantaneous, you can choose a number of targets in the area equal to the ability score modifier used to determine bonus spells of the same type (Charisma for [[bard]]s, [[oracle]]s, [[paladin]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, and [[summoner]]s; Intelligence for [[witch]]es and [[wizard]]s; Wisdom for [[cleric]]s, [[druid]]s, [[inquisitor]]s, and [[ranger]]s). These targets are excluded from the effects of your spell. A selective spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not have an area of effect or a duration of instantaneous do not benefit from this feat.
