Washing a creature with the soap requires water and takes 1 minute, after which the creature can attempt a new Will saving throw against any hostile ongoing mind-affecting effect currently affecting it. Unwilling creatures must be pinned or otherwise made helpless before they can be washed. The soap is sufficient to wash one creature.
