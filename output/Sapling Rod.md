Name: [[Sapling Rod]]
Aura: moderate conjuration and transmutation
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 16,650 gp
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This rod appears to be the limbless trunk and branching roots of a miniature tree. It grants its wielder a +5 competence bonus on Survival checks to get along in the wild and to keep from getting lost. Additionally the wielder and any allies within a 20-foot radius of the wielder gain the benefits of the [[ranger]]'s woodland stride class feature. If thrust into any natural ground or earth and allowed to stand for 1 hour, the rod grows and blooms into a large tree bearing edible fruit. A sapling rod produces 2d4 pieces of fruit. A creature that consumes an entire piece of fruit gains the benefits of either a cure moderate wounds or lesser restoration spell (recipient's choice). Consuming a piece of fruit from a sapling rod is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, and no single creature can benefit from more than two piece of fruit from a single blooming. A sapling rod can bloom once per week and after doing so reverts to its original state after all the fruit is picked, or after 24 hours, whichever comes first. Fruit harvested from the tree lasts for 24 hours before shriveling into useless husks.
Requirements: [[Craft Rod]], cure moderate wounds, grove of respite (Advanced Player's Guide), lesser restoration
