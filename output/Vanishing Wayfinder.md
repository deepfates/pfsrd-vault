CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 8,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Vanishing wayfinders are crafted of ivory chased with gold and silver. In addition to the usual functions of a wayfinder (including the ability to create light), as a standard action the holder of a vanishing wayfinder can press a hidden catch to become invisible (as the spell invisibility) for as long as she concentrates, up to a maximum duration of 5 minutes per day. These minutes need not be consecutive, but each activation counts as a minimum use of 1 minute, even if the user becomes visible because of an attack action or some other event before that minute is up.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], invisibility, light
