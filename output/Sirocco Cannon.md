Slot: item
Price: 184,500 gp
Weight: 100 lbs.
Description: This +1 shocking burst cannon (Ultimate Combat 162) is mounted on a brass carriage decorated with carvings of winds and storms. Three times per day, a sirocco cannon can be commanded to create a special type of ammunition. This ammunition functions as a normal cannonball, but on a successful hit, a gust of furnace-hot wind blasts downward in a 20-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder around the target or target square for 10 rounds. This hot wind deals 4d6+10 points of fire damage to all creatures in the area and knocks them prone. A successful DC 19 Fortitude save halves the fire damage and avoids being knocked prone. [[Fly]]ing creatures forced into the ground by the [[power]]ful downdraft take damage as if they fell unless they make a DC 15 [[Fly]] check, in which case they remain at their original altitude. Any creature that takes damage from the hot air becomes fatigued (or exhausted, if already fatigued, such as from a previous round of exposure). Creatures with the water subtype take a -4 penalty on all saving throws against this effect and take double normal damage. This special ammunition deals no additional damage to ships or structures.
