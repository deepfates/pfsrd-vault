Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 9
Slot: ring
Price: 11,000 gp
Weight: -
Description: Made of aged bronze and steel, this ring looks like it should have a gem set in it, but instead has an empty circular hole. The hole in the ring holds a single firearm bullet; if one is placed inside (as a full-round action), it merges seamlessly into the ring. While a bullet is merged into the ring, the wielder can fire the bullet as though she were using a +1 pistolUE that can't misfire. Once the bullet has been fired from the ring, a new bullet can't be placed inside for 24 hours. Each holdout ring is created with two +1 ammunition special abilities and one +2 ammunition special ability. If the wearer has the grit class feature, she can expend grit (maximum 4 grit points) to imbue bullets merged with the gun with one or more of these abilities. Imbuing a bullet with a +1 special ability costs 1 grit point; imbuing one with a +2 special ability costs 2 grit points. Each ring's special abilities are established upon the item's creation and can't be changed. If a special ability has multiple versions, as does bane, the specific version must be set at that time (e.g., dragon bane). A typical holdout ring has the flaming, seeking, and shocking burstUE special abilities.
