name: [[Trample]]
type: Mythic
description: Your rearing mount can stomp foes into the ground, barely breaking stride.
prerequisites: [[Trample]].
prerequisite_feats: [[Trample]]
benefit: Your mount can make two hoof attacks against an opponent you knock down with an overrun, instead of one. You can expend one use of mythic [[power]] when you score a critical hit with one or more of those hoof attacks. When you do, the critical is automatically confirmed. If both scored critical hits, expending one use of mythic [[power]] automatically confirms both.
