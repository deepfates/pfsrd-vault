Description: A staff of [[power]] is a potent magic item with varied offensive and defensive abilities, carved from magically hardened wood. It is usually topped with a glistening gem or orb that burns from within with a flickering red light. The staff allows the use of the following spells: • Continual flame (1 charge) • [[Fireball]] (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge) • [[Levitate]] (1 charge) • [[Light]]ning bolt (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge) • Magic missile (1 charge) • Ray of enfeeblement (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge) • Cone of cold (2 charges) • Globe of invulnerability (2 charges) • Hold monster (2 charges) • Wall of force (in a 10-ft.-diameter hemisphere around the caster only, 2 charges) The wielder of a staff of [[power]] gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. The staff is also a +2 quarterstaff, and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (a free action), the staff deals double damage (x3 on a critical hit) for 1 round. A staff of [[power]] can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot spread. All creatures and objects within 2 squares of the broken staff take an amount of damage equal to 20 x the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 15 x the number of charges, and those 5 or 6 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 10 x the number of charges. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half. The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence (01-50 on a d%), but if she does not, the explosive release of spell energy instantly destroys her. Only certain items, including the staff of the magi and the staff of [[power]], are capable of being used for a retributive strike.
Requirements: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], [[Craft Staff]], cone of cold, continual flame, heightened fireball, globe of invulnerability, hold monster, levitate, heightened lightning bolt, magic missile, heightened ray of enfeeblement, wall of force
