Name: [[Mistmail]]
Aura: faint conjuration
CL: 3
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 2,250 gp
Weight: 25 lbs.
Description: The fine links of this +1 chain shirt form a pattern of roiling clouds. On command once per day, the wearer can transform it into thick fog that fills his space and provides concealment (20% miss chance). This mist moves with the character. Effects that disperse the mist or destroy it cause the [[armor]] to reform into its solid shape on the character's body, as does speaking the command word or entering a place where the fog-magic doesn't function (such as underwater). If the character tries to don another suit of [[armor]] while the mistmail is in fog form, it reforms at the character's feet.
