Description: In 4692 AR, soon after the start of the Fourth Crusade, a [[paladin]] of [[Iomedae]] and renowned demon slayer named Yaniel spoke out against the [[Mendev]]ian crusaders, accusing them of negligence and sloth, and claiming these faults were what allowed Khorramzadeh to invade Kenabres and damage the wardstone. Her accusations cut too close to the truth, and in a moment of weakness her superiors threatened to excommunicate her. Instead, she [[sai]]d she would enter the [[Worldwound]] and fight the Fourth Crusade on her own, with only her magic sword [[Radiance]] for company. The church was happy to see Yaniel go, and in the 2 years that followed, she was thought to have been slain. Yet when she returned to Kenabres in 4694 ar, leading a small army of crusaders she'd rescued, both Yaniel and her superiors had changed. For her part, Yaniel had shed her pride and insubordination, and had gained a new appreciation for the difficult decisions leaders are forced to make. And the church leaders had learned that sometimes the truth is exactly what you need to hear. Alas, Yaniel was assassinated before the year was out, slain by the lilitu demon Minagho only a week into her second personal crusade. Her followers managed to return to Kenabres with [[Radiance]], but Yaniel's body had been taken. The sword had gone dark after Yaniel's death, its magical [[power]]s apparently lost, and so the crusaders elected to place it in the Gray Garrison on display. Yet several months ago it was stolen by the Templars of the Ivory Labyrinth, who plan to soon send the sword north to Drezen for corruption into a weapon of evil. [[Radiance]] was once a [[power]]ful weapon, yet since Yaniel's death the blade has become inert. When handled by a [[paladin]], however, the blade suddenly glows with golden light and functions as a +1 cold iron longsword that radiates light as a torch on command. The weapon shifts and changes its form to match the [[paladin]]'s deity's favored weapon (in the hands of a [[paladin]] who doesn't worship a deity, the weapon remains a +1 longsword). Certain events and tasks can awaken [[Radiance]]'s latent [[power]]s, eventually transforming it into a full-fledged holy avenger-these events are noted in the following adventures in Wrath of the Righteous as they occur. In addition, [[Radiance]] is a legendary item (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 169) that bonds with a mythic [[paladin]] a s soon as it is wielded in combat-in this adventure, [[Radiance]] bonds if a [[paladin]] uses it in the final encounter against Vorlesh's babaus. The weapon has two daily uses of legendary [[power]] that recharge each day, but does not currently possess any legendary attributes, for it has yet to be wielded by a mythic [[paladin]]. As [[Radiance]] has its own ability to grow in [[power]], it cannot be given the upgradable legendary item ability.
