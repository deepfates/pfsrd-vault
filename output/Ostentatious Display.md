benefit: As long as you are wearing a valuable nonmagical item in a magic item slot, you gain a +1 bonus on skill checks with a corresponding skill. Bonuses from wearing items in multiple slots that affect the same skill do not stack. Each item must be worth at least 5% of your character wealth by level (see Table 12-4 on page 399 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). For example, a 6th-level PC gains a +1 bonus on Bluff checks while wearing a gem-studded tiara (which fills the headband slot) worth at least 800 gp. When she reaches 7th level, she must wear an accessory in the appropriate slot worth at least 1,175 gp in order to continue gaining this bonus.
