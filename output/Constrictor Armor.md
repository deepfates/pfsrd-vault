Name: [[Constrictor Armor]]
Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 12
Slot: body
Price: 0
Weight: 30 lbs.
Description: Designed to resemble the wide scales on a serpent's belly, this [[armor]] functions as a +1 breastplate of fire resistance. The first time the wearer is struck in melee, the [[armor]] animates and begins crushing its wearer. On the round that the [[armor]] animates, it automatically grapples the wearer. In following rounds, at the beginning of the wearer's turn, the [[armor]] makes a grapple combat maneuver check (CMB +20) to constrict the wearer. If successful, the [[armor]] deals 2d6 points of damage each round. Once animated, the [[armor]] releases its grip only when it is destroyed or its wearer dies. The wearer can't physically remove the [[armor]] once it activates, but others can help destroy or remove it. This [[armor]] functions normally (without animating) when worn by unliving creatures such as constructs and undead.
