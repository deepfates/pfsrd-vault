Name: [[Nahyndrian Elixir]]
Aura: strong conjuration and necromancy [evil]
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This thick, syrupy, deep purple elixir contains within it the ability to infuse a drinker with a tiny fragment of a dead demon lord's mythic [[power]]. So potent is this elixir that it must be stored in a magically reinforced cold iron flask capped with a mixture of lead and demon ichor-the flask itself is essentially a wondrous magic item that does nothing else and costs 8,000 gp to craft. Even then, the elixir's essence fills a 10-foot-radius area with unholy energies that sicken all living creatures (this is a poison effect with no saving throw). If the flask is opened, this radius expands to 30 feet. A thin sheet of lead, 1 inch of common metal, or 1 foot of stone blocks this effect. Once the flask is opened, the elixir must be imbibed within 1 minute; re-capping the elixir at this point doesn't reset or pause this countdown. If the elixir has not been imbibed in that time, the energy within explodes in a 30-foot-radius burst that deals 15d6 points of unholy damage (Will DC 25 half) to all creatures in the area of effect, destroying the elixir. If a creature drinks a Nahyndrian elixir, it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or take 4d6 points of Constitution drain (demons automatically succeed). If a non-mythic chaotic evil creature succeeds, it undergoes mythic ascension-gaining either the first tier in a mythic path or a mythic rank, at the GM's discretion. A chaotic evil creature that is already mythic treats a Nahyndrian elixir as nectar of the gods (Pathfinder RPG Mythic Adventures 155). Nahyndrian elixirs have the same strange immunity to teleportation effects as Nahyndrian crystals.
