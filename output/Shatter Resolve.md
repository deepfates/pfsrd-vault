name: [[[[Shatter]] Resolve]]
type: General
description: Damaging a foe with negative energy causes despair.
prerequisites: Channel negative energy class feature, worshiper of [[Urgathoa]].
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: When you damage a creature by channeling negative energy, you fill it with fear. A creature that is affected by your channel negative energy ability and fails its Will save to halve the damage also becomes shaken for a number of rounds equal to the number of dice used to calculate the damage caused by the channel energy ability (so if you deal 1d6 points of damage, the condition lasts 1 round; if 2d6 points of damage, then 2 rounds, and so on).
