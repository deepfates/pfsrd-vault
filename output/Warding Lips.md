Name: [[Warding Lips]]
Aura: moderate conjuration and necromancy
CL: 7
Slot: item
Price: 1,900 gp
Weight: -
Description: When placed upon the lips, these thin, translucent sheets of wax melt invisibly onto the user's mouth. The user is aware of-but unaffected by-any magical attacks or effects that might harm him through the lips or mouth (such as a succubus's energy drain attack). In addition, the next time he would be exposed to an ingested poison, the warding lips instead absorb the toxin and leave him unharmed. Once exposed to a magical attack or ingested poison, a set of warding lips loses its magic and becomes useless.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], death ward, neutralize poison
Cost: 950 gp
