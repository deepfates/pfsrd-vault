name: [[Ride-By Attack]]
type: Mythic
description: You can make multiple attacks as you ride past your enemies.
prerequisites: [[Ride-By Attack]].
prerequisite_feats: [[Ride-By Attack]]
benefit: When you successfully strike an opponent as part of a [[Ride-By Attack]], you can continue to make attacks against successive targets. You can make one additional attack per 3 tiers you possess, but you can't make more attacks than you could if you were making a full attack. Successive attacks use the lower bonus for multiple attacks, as when making a full attack. You must move at least 10 feet between each attack.
