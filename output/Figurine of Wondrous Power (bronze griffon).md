Name: [[Figurine of Wondrous Power (bronze griffon)]]
Aura: Moderate transmutation
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 10,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Each of the several kinds of figurines of wondrous [[power]] appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak. If a figurine of wondrous [[power]] is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its [[power]] departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. Bronze Griffon: When animated, a bronze griffon acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary). The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the bronze griffon once again becomes a tiny statuette.
