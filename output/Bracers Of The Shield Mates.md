Name: [[Bracers Of The [[Shield]] Mates]]
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 7
Slot: wrists
Price: 40,000 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: These heavy, bronze bracers depict scenes of epic battle and heroic sacrifice. When worn together, they provide no benefit. When two individuals each wear a single bracer, each wearer gains a +2 shield bonus to AC as long as the two remain within 100 feet of each other. By expending one use of mythic [[power]] as a swift action, the wearer of one of the bracers can teleport up to 100 feet per mythic tier to any unoccupied space adjacent to the other wearer. The wearer acts normally for the remainder of her turn, then immediately teleports back to her original space when her turn ends. Effects that prevent dimensional travel either from the wearer's space or to her destination block this ability.
