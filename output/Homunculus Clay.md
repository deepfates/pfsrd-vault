Name: [[Homunculus Clay]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 4,100 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: If a mutagen is poured onto this fist-sized lump of dry clay (a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity), it transforms into a homunculus. It treats the [[alchemist]] who provided the mutagen as its creator. The homunculus gains the benefits of the mutagen. For every 2 points its Constitution would be increased, it instead gains 1 additional hit point per Hit Die and a +1 bonus on Fortitude saves, and the DC of its poison increases by 1. When the effect of the mutagen ends or the homunculus is slain, it reverts to a lump of clay that can be used again at a later time. If the homunculus clay is broken or destroyed in its inactive form, it is forever ruined.
Requirements: Craft [[Construct]], [[Craft Wondrous Item]], animate objects, arcane eye, mending, mirror image, creator must have 2 ranks in Craft (alchemy) and 2 ranks in Craft (sculptures)
