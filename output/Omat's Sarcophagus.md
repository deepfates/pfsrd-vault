Description: [[Omat's Sarcophagus]] is similar in appearance to the sarcophagi used in the burial rites of many ancient pharaohs. It is constructed from wood, and its surface is sealed with pitch and set with an alternating pattern of scaled bands carved from lapis lazuli and jasper and scribed with thousands of protective hieroglyphs. All other exposed surfaces are gilded. Although this item appears to be a normal sarcophagus, it has a number of special [[power]]s. Each of these effects can be used once per day, and they affect only creatures of the humanoid type. If a humanoid that has been dead for less than 1 month is placed inside [[Omat's Sarcophagus]] and the lid is sealed, the corpse's soul is forced into the sarcophagus and trapped there. The corpse then disintegrates and the sarcophagus begins building a new young-adult body over the course of 2d12 days. This effect occurs even if the original creature had reached the end of its natural life. The body created is free of all physical ills and afflictions that the creature may have previously suffered. Once the new body is complete, the soul is then forced into the new body and the being awakens in the sarcophagus. If the sarcophagus is destroyed before the soul can be united with the newly formed body, the soul is once again released to the afterlife. If a living creature is placed inside [[Omat's Sarcophagus]], it can use the device to travel to the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, or [[Pharasma]]'s Boneyard. To activate this teleportation [[power]], a creature must be inside the sarcophagus with the lid closed. The user must then recite aloud the sacred poem of Neb-Aku (which is inscribed on the interior of the sarcophagus's lid) in Ancient Osiriani. The recitation immediately opens a portal, and the user can then move through the portal to the desired plane (chosen after reciting the poem). The sarcophagus doesn't confer any abilities that protect the user while on another plane. For up to 48 hours after using [[Omat's Sarcophagus]] to travel to another plane, the user can utter a command word to be immediately transported back to the sarcophagus. After this time passes, the user must find her own way back to the Material Plane.
