name: [[Thoughtful Discernment]]
type: General
description: Thinking back, you discover a lie in what you once thought to be words of truth.
prerequisites: Discern lies class feature.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: Once per day as a free action, you can think back about a single statement you heard in the last day and determine if it was a lie. This acts like the discern lies spell, but instead of affecting a creature, it affects a single statement a creature has made. For example, if the king told you, "My daughter is in the monster's dungeon" before you left to find her, as long as the king [[sai]]d that to you within the past day, you can use this feat to determine whether or not the king deliberately and knowingly lied to you when he made that statement.
