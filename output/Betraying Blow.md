name: [[Betraying Blow]]
type: Combat
description: When you break an alliance, you make sure it's broken for good.
prerequisites: [[Solo Maneuvers]], base attack bonus +8.
prerequisite_feats: [[Solo Maneuvers]]
benefit: Whenever you use a melee attack to deal nonlethal damage to a creature that only you threaten, roll a Bluff check opposed by your opponent's Sense Motive check. You deal an additional amount of nonlethal damage equal to 1/2 the difference between your Bluff check and your opponent's Sense Motive check (minimum 0). If your opponent has an attitude of friendly or helpful toward you (including temporarily due to Intimidate checks, charm person, and similar effects), you instead deal an amount of extra nonlethal damage equal to the difference between your checks. Regardless, the amount of extra nonlethal damage you deal with this feat cannot exceed your Hit Dice.
