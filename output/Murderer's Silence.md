Name: [[Murderer's [[Silence]]]]
Aura: faint conjuration
CL: 3
Slot: item
Price: 900 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: In magical societies, speak with dead has captured many a murderer, and so this serum was invented by assassins to silence their victims. Murderer's silence prevents a corpse from communicating via speak with dead by dissolving the victim's vocal organs. To use this item, the thick black liquid must be slowly poured down the throat of the corpse (a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity). The following round, the corpse's tongue, vocal cords, and lips deteriorate and the corpse becomes incapable of responding to speak with dead. Other means of interrogating the spirit of the departed still function normally. The price listed is for a single dose.
