Name: [[Empyreal Armor]]
Aura: strong evocation [fire]
CL: 13
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 100,050 gp
Weight: 50 lbs.
Description: Legend tells that the first suits of empyreal [[armor]] were forged from the battered, cast-off breastplates worn by solars in battle. These suits were gifted to [[power]]ful mortal heroes and have since changed hands many times. Empyreal [[armor]] is made of steel forged so that it reflects a golden sheen in the sunlight. This [[armor]] functions as a suit of +3 moderate fortification full plate. In addition, three times per day, its wearer can activate a fire shield (warm shield only) that lasts for 13 rounds. Any creature attacking the wearer with its body or a handheld weapon while the fire shield effect is active deals normal damage but takes 1d6+13 points of damage in return. Half this damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine [[power]] and is therefore not subject to energy resistance.
