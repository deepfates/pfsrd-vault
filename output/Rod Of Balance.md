Slot: item

Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This short, slender rod appears to be crafted from solid iron, though it is incredibly light. In this shortened form, the rod has no [[power]]s. However, when the wielder pushes a small button on one end of the rod (a move action), the rod springs open to a 5-foot length, and its [[power]]s become available for use. Once extended, the rod possesses several [[power]]s that add to the wielder's acrobatic abilities. The wielder of the rod receives a +10 competence bonus on all [[Acrobatic]]s checks involving long jumps and high jumps; additionally, the wielder covers double the normal distance for a jump when making an [[Acrobatic]]s check. The individual holding the rod also gain a +4 dodge bonus to AC when fighting defensively instead of the usual +2 bonus. Also, while using this item, the user of the rod cannot be knocked prone, and takes only half damage from falling. A rod of balance emits a faint aura of the abjuration and transmutation schools.
