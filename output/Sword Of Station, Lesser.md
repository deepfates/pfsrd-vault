Name: [[[[Sword Of Station]], Lesser]]
Aura: faint abjuration and enchantment
CL: 1
Slot: belt
Price: 360 gp
Weight: 5 lbs
Description: This ornate sword and belt impart uncanny confidence and insight while worn, granting a +2 competence bonus on Sense Motive checks. Three times per day, the wearer may draw the sword and deliver a single-word command, as per the spell. Lesser versions of swords of station exist that allow the wearer to cast command only once per day, and that lack the confidence-boosting enhancements. For greater swords of station, the competence bonus on Sense Motive checks increases to +5. A sword of station is blunted and poorly balanced, intended as a showpiece rather than a weapon. If used in combat, treat it as an improvised club.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], command, remove fear, creator must have 2 ranks in the Sense Motive skill
Cost: 180 gp
