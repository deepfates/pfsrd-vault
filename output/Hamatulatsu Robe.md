Name: [[[[Hamatulatsu]] Robe]]
Aura: moderate evocation and transmutation
CL: 10
Slot: body
Price: 14,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Made of exquisite crimson silk, this variant [[monk]]'s robe is embroidered with golden pentagrams and other fiendish symbols. If the wearer is evil and has levels in [[monk]], her AC bonus and unarmed damage are treated as if she were a [[monk]] of 5 levels higher (maximum 20). If the wearer is evil but not a [[monk]], she gains the AC bonus and unarmed damage of a 5th-level [[monk]] (although she doesn't add her Wisdom bonus to her AC). This AC bonus otherwise functions just like the [[monk]]'s AC bonus. If the robe is donned by a character with the [[Hamatulatsu]] feat (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 287), the duration of the sickened effect increases to 2 rounds. If the wearer doesn't have the [[Hamatulatsu]] feat, she gains this feat while wearing the robes, but gains no further benefits to that ability.
