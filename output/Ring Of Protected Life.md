Name: [[Ring Of Protected Life]]
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 7
Slot: ring
Price: 9,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This silver ring features arboreal motifs, and is set with a small but brilliant sapphire. If the wearer has the channel energy class feature, the radius of his channeled energy increases by 5 feet. Additionally, when the wearer channels energy, he may choose to exempt one creature from the effects of his channeling. If the wearer has the [[Selective Channeling]] feat, the ring of protected life increases the number of creatures he may normally exempt by one. Finally, once per day the wearer may channel energy as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity; doing so renders the ring of protected life inert for 24 hours, during which time it does not confer any benefits.
Requirements: [[Forge Ring]], [[Selective Channeling]], creator must have the channel energy class feature
