Name: [[Headband Of Havoc]]
Aura: faint enchantment
CL: 5
Slot: headband
Price: 8,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This band of raggedly stitched animal skins and teeth [[focus]]es a [[barbarian]] wearer's bloodlust. When the wearer enters a rage, she selects one of her rage [[power]]s. For the duration of the rage, that [[power]] functions as if the wearer's [[barbarian]] level were four levels higher. Once per day when the wearer is attacked or has to make a saving throw against a hostile effect, she may spend 2 rounds of rage to begin a rage as an immediate action. This rage becomes active prior to resolving the attack that triggered it and lasts until the start of her next turn (at which time she may continue to rage as if she had begun the rage in the normal manner).
