Name: [[Judicial Hammer]]
Aura: faint enchantment
CL: 4
Slot: item
Price: 5,220 gp
Weight: 14 lbs.
Description: The head of this +1 earth breaker (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment 27) is shaped like a massive version of the gavel one might see in a court of law-the weapon is nearly 4 feet long from end to end. The Hellknights of Citadel Vraid are attributed with crafting the first judicial hammers, having adopted their form from the weapons of the same Shoanti tribes they used the judicial hammers against. Once per day, the wielder may speak the judicial hammer's command word and name a specific crime he believes an individual within 30 feet has committed. Whenever the designated target takes damage from the judicial hammer, the target must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or immediately and truthfully confess its innocence or guilt in the named crime (if the target can speak the same language as the wielder of the judicial hammer, it must confess in this language). This effect lasts for 24 hours or until the creature fails its Will save, whichever comes first.
