name: [[Bat Shape]]
type: General
description: Your [[power]]s of transformation have been honed to the point where you can wholly become a bat.
prerequisites: Cha 13, werebat-kin.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: You can take the form of a bat whose appearance is static and cannot be changed each time you assume this form. You gain a +10 racial bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a bat. Changing from werebat-kin to bat shape is a standard action. This ability otherwise functions as beast shape II, and your ability scores change accordingly. If you wear a bat pelt (see page 31), you may choose to adopt a form resembling the bat whose skin you wear instead of your normal bat form.
