Description: This roll of tanned horsehide contains pockets that hold ceremonial gear such as incense, candles, and tiny bells as well as a small, carved stone idol in the shape of a totem spirit such as a dragon or other creature known for its wisdom. Anyone who unrolls the kit and spends 10 minutes performing a special ritual either increases her caster level by 1 for any divination spell she begins casting immediately after concluding the ritual, or gains a +3 insight bonus to any one skill check she makes in the next hour. Alternatively, she may spend all remaining uses of the kit in an hour-long ritual to cast commune, asking one question for every two remaining uses in the kit. A newly created set of prophetic paraphernalia has 10 uses. When all of the uses are expended, the stone idol crumbles into powder.
