Name: [[Tannaris, Sword Of Envy]]
Aura: strong abjuration
CL: 16
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 7 lbs.
Description: A purely cosmetic magical effect causes the elegant blade of this +5 defending bastard sword to cycle through distinctive colors and textures, making it appear to be crafted from massive pieces of gemstone, coral, or precious metals. When used to augment the wielder's Armor Class, the sword's enhancement bonus does not cease augmenting attacks and damage. Additionally, whenever Tannaris strikes a creature under the effects of a spell, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or have the highest level spell currently affecting it instantly dispelled (as if by the spell dispel magic; no additional dispel check is required). This ability has no special effect on summoned creatures or persistent spell effects. If the sword scores a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or have all of the spells currently affecting it dispelled (as per the spell greater dispel magic; no additional dispel checks are required).
