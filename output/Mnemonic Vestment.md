Name: [[Mnemonic Vestment]]
Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 17
Slot: body
Price: 5,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: The surface of this delicate-looking blue silk robe is adorned with tiny embossed runes across its entire surface. If the wearer is a spontaneous caster, once per day she may use a spell slot to cast a spell from a written source (such as a scroll or spellbook) as if she knew that spell. The spell must be on her spell list, the same spell level or lower than the expended spell slot, and the same type of spell (arcane or divine) as the spell slot expended. The caster must also understand the written source (such as using Decipher Script or read magic) and be carrying it. Activating the robe is not an action, but casting the spell otherwise works as normal, including casting time, providing components or foci, and so on. Using a mnemonic vestment's properties does not consume the written source.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], mnemonic enhancer, creator must be able to spontaneously cast spells
