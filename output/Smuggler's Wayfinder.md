Name: Smuggler's [[Wayfinder]]
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 2,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This time-weathered wayfinder lacks any notable features. Despite its routine appearance, a smuggler's wayfinder has an additional ability generally known only to the person using it. When a command word is spoken, the compass's interior is replaced with a small extradimensional space that can hold up to 10 pounds of material occupying no more than 1 cubic foot of space. This material must be able to fit through the 3-inch-diameter opening in the compass's face (such as a thin glass vial, coins, small jewelry, or a rolled-up piece of paper). While the extradimensional space is accessible, all other properties of the wayfinder cease to function, including any resonant ioun stone [[power]]s. While the extradimensional space is hidden, the smuggler's wayfinder emits an aura of faint evocation, as a standard wayfinder.
