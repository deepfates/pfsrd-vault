Name: [[Cage Of Soul Echoes]]
Aura: strong conjuration and necromancy
CL: 18
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 60 lbs.
Description: The Cage of Soul Echoes can be used to create a rift into the ethereal plane. The rift works in a similar fashion to a gate spell; however, some of the ethereal plane leaks into the surrounding plane, creating a strange ethereal mist. The artifact can be manipulated to control the speed, strength, and direction of the current. Settings Static: The current remains stationary. Once this state is triggered, the mists fill with ghosts and [[spirits]] of the departed. An individual who stands within the cage can speak with the departed and ask them questions. This [[power]] works as speak with dead. Output: The ethereal mist flows in a current that draws living things into the ethereal plane, as the telekinesis spell (CL 18). Input: Ethereal mist rushes from the cage, erupting into the area in great ghostly tendrils. Lashing frantically, they discharge bolts of supernatural cold into all living creatures they touch. Creatures from the ethereal plane can freely travel into the plane when the cage is activated. The input state is a protection, predominantly used to ward off enemies seeking to steal or tamper with the device when its owner is traveling the ethereal plane.
