Description: The cut and color of this solemn vestment varies from religion to religion, but its properties are the same. The wearer may command the cassock of the clergy to display the holy symbol of her deity or hide this symbol. At the most basic level, the garment functions as a divine [[focus]]. Additionally, the wearer gains a +3 competence bonus on Charisma-based checks to influence creatures that match her alignment or that of her patron deity. Also, the wearer may use bless and sanctuary (DC 11) each once per day, and may prepare one additional orison each day. If the wearer is a spontaneous divine caster, once per day she may spend 1 hour in prayer to gain an orison of her choice as a spell known for the next 24 hours.
