Name: [[Pipes of Shifting Tempo]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 18,000 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: In outer construction and manner of play, pipes of shifting tempo resemble a typical set of unremarkable pan pipes, but the complex chambers within the pipes are modeled after difficult-to-duplicate Azlanti instruments. Music created by these pipes sounds unusually mournful, with a strange, almost warbling subtext to the notes. Up to three times per day, a user can attempt to harness these pipes' [[power]] by making a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check as a standard action. With a successful check, the possessor can play a grave melody to cast slow or an allegro melody to cast haste. The resulting spell functions as normal for the item's caster level, affecting five creatures per casting.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], haste, slow, Perform (wind instrument) 5 ranks
