Description: A razored rope is a +1 lasso made out of tightly braided lengths of fine chain, used to help restrain cowards attempting to flee a battle. It can be used to entangle an opponent as normal, but deals 1d4 points of damage to a creature that attempts to slip free and fails. The razored rope is also more difficult to escape from, requiring a DC 18 Escape Artist check to slip free from and a DC 28 Strength check to break. If [[Gorum]] is your patron, as a standard action you can cause the lasso to constrict around a creature already entangled by the rope, dealing 1d4 points of damage. If [[Gorum]] is not your patron and you attempt to make the lasso constrict, it lashes up and strikes you for 1d4 points of damage.
