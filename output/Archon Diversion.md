name: [[Archon Diversion]]
type: Combat
description: You are able to throw yourself in front of danger to protect your friends.
prerequisites: [[Archon Style]], Combat [[Expert]]ise, [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], base attack bonus +4 or [[monk]] level 4th.
prerequisite_feats: [[Archon Style]], Combat [[Expert]]ise, [[Improved Unarmed Strike]]
benefit: The penalty to AC for using [[Archon Style]] to grant nearby allies a bonus to AC against a single opponent decreases to -1, and you can spend a move action instead of a standard action to use this ability. Once per round while using [[Archon Style]], when you have at least one hand free, you can divert one melee weapon attack that would have struck an adjacent ally and take the blow in your ally's stead, using your own AC to determine whether the attack hits you. Whether or not a diverted attack actually hits you, the ally you protected can make an attack of opportunity against the diverted opponent. You expend no action to divert the attack, but you must be aware of it and must not be flat-footed. You must declare that you are using this feat after your opponent has declared the target of its melee attack but before it makes its attack roll.
