Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: The [[Vernal Key]] consists of three lattice orbs, one inside the other, all carved from a single piece of blue mineral. The key was created to unlock a jarl's prison, but as a side effect it also protects the region around it from the ravages of winter. Within a 5-mile radius of the [[Vernal Key]], otherwise cold weather (below 40&#176; F) becomes moderate, while severe cold (below 0&#176; F) becomes only cold. A mild wind demarcates the edge of this effect. The key must remain stationary (unattended) to produce this effect; it takes 24 hours for the artifact to attune itself to its locale. The key only ameliorates natural weather; it has no effect on magically created effects or extraplanar environments.
