name: [[Wolf Savage]]
type: Combat
description: You can savage vulnerable foes so badly they become supernaturally disfigured.
prerequisites: Wis 17, [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Wolf Style]], [[Wolf Trip]], Knowledge (nature) 9 ranks.
prerequisite_feats: [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], [[Wolf Style]], [[Wolf Trip]]
benefit: Whenever you deal a prone opponent at least 10 points of damage with a natural weapon or unarmed strike, you can savage your foe as a swift action. Your victim becomes disf igured unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modif ier). The effects of this disf igurement are identical to those of a bestow curse spell (caster level equal to your character level).
