Name: [[Morlock Hide]]
Aura: moderate illusion and transmutation
CL: 10
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 8,910 gp
Weight: 15 lbs.
Description: This +1 shadow leather [[armor]] causes the wearer's skin to warp and distort into a welter of horrid scarification. The [[armor]] itself disappears from view under this coat of scars and the wearer's face appears as a loathsome, eyeless veil of flesh. This change is illusory, similar to glamered [[armor]]; however, morlock hide does cause the wearer's arms and legs to extend and her posture to become hunched. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus on [[Acrobatic]]s, Climb, and Escape Artist checks, and she can move through narrow spaces while squeezing at normal speed and with no penalty to AC or on attack rolls.
Requirements: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], alter self, invisibility
