Name: [[Knucklebone of Fickle Fortune]]
Aura: strong (all schools)
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: -
Description: At first sight, the artifact appears to be nothing more than a piece of bone worn down to a near sphere, but when a creature picks it up, the knucklebone's true [[power]] and nature becomes apparent. When a creature holding the knucklebone of fickle fortune looks upon it, he sees that the bone is actually a perfectly shaped die with 20 sides, each side bearing a glowing red symbol of [[power]]. When the creature rolls the die, instead of falling to the floor it rolls upward in midair, stopping at the eye level of the creature who rolled it. It then takes its effect, based on the side immediately facing its caster. Roll a 20-sided die to determine the effect (see Table 7-13). For effects that are lost if the die is rolled again (such as #17) or a specific result is rolled (such as #14), the character is aware of this restriction.

[[Destruction]]: The knucklebone of fickle fortune disappears if its Eha-Zah face (a 20 on the die) comes up on 20 consecutive rolls. Some sages believe that this does not destroy the artifact, and it instead reappears at some random spot in the [[world]], but such knowledge is purely conjecture, for it is not known whether anyone has accomplished this improbable task.
