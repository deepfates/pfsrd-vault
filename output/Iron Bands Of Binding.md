Aura: strong evocation
CL: 13
Slot: item
Price: 26,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This potent item is a 3-inch-diameter rusty iron sphere wrapped in iron bands. When the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is hurled at an opponent, the bands expand and then contract to bind the target creature on a successful ranged touch attack. A single Large or smaller creature can be captured thus and held immobile (as if pinned) until the command word is spoken to bring the bands into spherical form again. The creature can break (and destroy) the bands with a DC 30 Strength check or escape them with a DC 30 combat maneuver check or Escape Artist check. Iron bands of binding are usable once per day.
