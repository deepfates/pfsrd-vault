Weight: 1 lb.
Description: A mournful razor is a +3 vorpal war razor capable of inflicting particularly distressing and demoralizing wounds. The weapon resizes automatically to fit the hand of its wielder, from Tiny to Huge. Regardless of the weapon's size, it always functions as a light weapon. Each time a mournful razor damages a foe, the blade absorbs a tiny fraction of that foe's despair and sadness. Whenever a creature takes sneak attack damage from a mournful razor, the creature so damaged must succeed at a DC 16 Will save or be infused with these thoughts of despair and self-loathing. The target so affected by the weapon has a 50% chance to act normally each turn; otherwise, it takes no action. This curse persists as long as the target remains wounded from any source (it ends immediately once the victim is completely healed of all damage).
