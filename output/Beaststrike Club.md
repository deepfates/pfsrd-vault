Name: [[Beaststrike Club]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 6
Slot: item
Price: 7,300 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: This +1 club is often decorated with large teeth and carved with stylized images of different animals. As a standard action, the wielder may transform the club into the head or limb of an animal; the weapon's damage does not change but the type of damage changes to one of the following to suit the shape of the club: bite (piercing), claw (slashing), gore (piercing), slam (bludgeoning), sting (piercing), or talon (slashing). When transformed, the club counts as a natural weapon and a manufactured weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured or natural weapons. The club also counts as the natural weapon of its current shape for the purpose of feats and spells that rely on specific natural weapons, such as [[Weapon Focus]] (bite) or the bloody claws spell (Advanced Player's Guide). If the wielder has the wild shape ability, she can expend one use of wildshape to increase the weapon's damage by one step (Core Rulebook 145) for the duration of that wild shape as long as the [[druid]] remains in contact with the weapon; if the wielder can wild shape at will, the club's damage is always increased in this fashion. If unattended, the club reverts to its normal shape.
