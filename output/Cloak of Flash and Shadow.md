Name: [[Cloak of Flash and Shadow]]
Aura: minor illusion
CL: 3
Slot: shoulders
Price: 11,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Designed to meet the dual needs of the Chelish elite-glamour and subtlety-the cloak of flash and shadow is a magic reversible cloak. When worn one way, the cloak shimmers with heavy gold and silver embroidery against richly colored silk, and grants you a +2 enhancement bonus to Charisma. When worn inside-out, the matte-black lining seems to absorb light, cloaking you in shadow and giving you a +2 competence bonus on Stealth checks. In this configuration you can cast blur three times per day. Reversing the cloak's position is a standard action and requires at least one free hand.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], blur, eagle's splendor
Cost: 5,500 gp
Group: Wondrous Item
