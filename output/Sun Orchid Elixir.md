Description: [[Thuvia]]'s sun orchid elixir is a nearly perfect solution for those who seek eternal life. A single dose of sun orchid elixir cannot stop the aging process, but it does the next-best thing-it restores youth. A creature that drinks the elixir is restored to its starting age as a young adult. The drinker's new age is randomly determined using Table 7-1 on page 169 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. All penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution the drinker may have suffered as a result of advanced age are removed, but all bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma that result from advanced age remain (although as the character ages again into middle age and beyond, he does not gain any of these bonuses a second time). Vanity-seekers go to nearly any length to acquire the elixir, resorting to bribery, extortion, and murder. To curtail such troubles in the land of its creation, the use of the elixir is outlawed in [[Thuvia]] (except by the formula's creator). Each vial of sun orchid elixir requires six mature sun orchids and 1 month's time to ferment, although the exact formula used is a secret known only to the denizen of [[Alchemist]]'s Keep in [[Thuvia]]. Prices for a dose of the elixir vary wildly since the elixir is sold at auction, but no dose has ever sold for less than 50,000 gp.
