name: [[Marid Coldsnap]]
type: Combat
description: You can summon a torrent of water to blast your enemies, chilling them to the bone.
prerequisites: Con 15, Wis 17, [[Elemental Fist]]**, [[Marid Spirit]], [[Marid Style]], [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], base attack bonus +13 or [[monk]] level 11th.
prerequisite_feats: [[Elemental Fist]], [[Marid Spirit]], [[Marid Style]], [[Improved Unarmed Strike]]
benefit: While using [[Marid Style]], as a standard action, you can spend two [[Elemental Fist]] (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempts to unleash a 30-foot line of frigid water. Creatures caught in the line take your unarmed strike damage plus the cold damage from your [[Elemental Fist]] attack and are entangled in ice as per the [[Marid Spirit]] feat. A successful Ref lex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from becoming entangled.
