Name: [[Horn Of Valhalla]]
Aura: strong conjuration
CL: 13
Slot: item
Price: 50,000 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This magic instrument comes in four varieties. Each appears to be a normal, scarred old horn used for hunting or signaling during battle. When someone speaks its command word and blows the horn, however, the horn summons a number of human [[barbarian]]s to fight for the character who summoned them. Each horn can be blown just once every 7 days. Roll d% and refer to the table above to see what type of horn is found. The horn's type determines what [[barbarian]]s are summoned and what prerequisite is needed to use the horn. Any character who uses a horn of Valhalla but doesn't have the prerequisite is attacked by the [[barbarian]]s she herself summoned. Summoned [[barbarian]]s are constructs, not actual people (though they seem to be); they arrive with the starting equipment for [[barbarian]]s. They attack anyone the possessor of the horn commands them to fight until they or their opponents are slain or until 1 hour has elapsed, whichever comes first. d% TYPE OF HORN BARBARIANS SUMMONED PREREQUISITE 01-40 Silver 2d4+2, 2nd-level None 41-75 Brass 2d4+1, 3rd-level Spellcaster level 1st 76-90 Bronze 2d4, 4th-level Proficiency with all martial weapons or [[bard]]ic performance ability 91-100 Iron 1d4+1, 5th-level Proficiency with all martial weapons or [[bard]]ic performance ability
