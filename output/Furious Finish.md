description: You channel all of your rage into one massive blow to crush your enemy.
prerequisites: [[Rage]] class feature, [[Vital Strike]], base attack bonus +6.
prerequisite_feats: [[Vital Strike]]
benefit: While raging, when you use the [[Vital Strike]] feat, you can choose not to roll your damage dice and instead deal damage equal to the maximum roll possible on those damage dice. If you do, your rage immediately ends, and you are fatigued (even if you would not normally be).
