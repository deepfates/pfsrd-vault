Description: This sphere originates within the Negative Energy Plane as either a naturally occurring phenomenon or a normal sphere of annihilation em[[power]]ed or even damaged by beings there. The sphere of bleeding snowflakes radiates a cold, dense fog of black energy extending 60 feet into its surrounding area, infusing the region with negative energy, and dealing 4d6 negative energy damage (as a [[cleric]]'s channeled energy) and 1 permanent negative level per round to everything within 60 feet. While spells such as death ward may negate the energy's ill effects, any who die as a result of these effects, or who die by other means within the sphere's affected radius, cannot be returned to life by anything short of true resurrection, wish, or miracle.
