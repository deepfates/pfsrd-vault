Name: [[Magi Staff of the Necromancer]]
Aura: strong (all schools)
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This long staff of smooth, pale bone is bent in a swaying shape, like a crone's back, and is carved with ancient symbols of death and [[spirits]], with the writing standing out in stark black from a thick paste of human ash rubbed into it. Any good creature who holds or carries the staff gains two permanent negative levels (similar to holding an unholy weapon). The staff's [[power]]s (and the equivalent staff of the magi [[power]]s they replace) are: • detect undead (detect magic, 0 charges) • disrupt undead (enlarge person, 0 charges) • spectral hand (knock, 1 charge) • vampiric touch (lightning bolt, 1 charge) • animate dead (wall of fire, 1 charge) • finger of death (plane shift, 2 charges) • energy drain (monster summoning IX, 2 charges) The staff otherwise has the normal [[power]]s and abilities of a staff of the magi. If broken in a retributive strike, the bearer has a 25% chance to be transported to the Negative Energy Plane, a 50% chance to be transported to a random plane, and a 25% chance to be utterly destroyed. Rumor has it that the staff contains a hollow space to hold a lich's phylactery, though arcane scholars point out that no sane lich would keep his life essence in a magic item that explodes when broken.
