Name: [[[[Crystal Ball]] standard]]
Aura: moderate divination
CL: 10
Slot: item
Price: 42,000 gp
Weight: 7 lbs.
Description: This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. So well-known are these items that many so-called [[oracle]]s or fortune-tellers use similar appearing (but completely non-magical) replicas of these items to ply their trades. A character can use a magical crystal ball to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell scrying (Will DC 16 negates). A crystal ball can be used multiple times per day, but the DC to resist its [[power]] decreases by 1 for each additional use. Certain crystal balls have additional [[power]]s that can be used through the crystal ball on the target viewed.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], scrying (plus any additional spells put into item)
