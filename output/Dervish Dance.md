name: [[Dervish Dance]]
type: Combat
description: You have learned to turn your speed into [[power]], even with a heavier blade.
prerequisites: Dexterity 13, [[Weapon Finesse]], Perform (dance) 2 ranks, proficient with scimitar.
prerequisite_feats: [[Weapon Finesse]]
benefit: When wielding a scimitar with one hand, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on melee attack and damage rolls. You treat the scimitar as a one-handed piercing weapon for all feats and class abilities that require such a weapon (such as a duelist's precise strike ability). The scimitar must be for a creature of your size. You cannot use this feat if you are carrying a weapon or shield in your off hand.
