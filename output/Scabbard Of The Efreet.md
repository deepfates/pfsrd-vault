Description: These black-and-red leather scab[[bard]]s are produced in the distant Padishah Empire of Kelesh; in the Inner Sea region, they are predominantly found in [[Qadira]]. Each scab[[bard]] fits any bladed weapon, and has the bound essence of an efreeti within. Any weapon drawn from the scab[[bard]] gains the flaming weapon special ability for 5 rounds. Three times per day on command, the scab[[bard]] can impart the flaming burst (Ultimate Equipment 141) weapon special ability to a weapon drawn from it for 10 rounds. Once per day, the wielder can summon a pyroclastic storm when drawing a weapon from the scab[[bard]]. Treat this as an ice storm spell that deals fire damage instead of cold damage. The storm is centered on the location of the wielder, but doesn't harm or otherwise affect her.
