Name: [[Cauldron Of The Dead]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 30,000 gp
Weight: 35 lbs.
Description: This cauldron of dark iron is large enough to accommodate a single [[Medium]] creature. When filled with a mixture of water and rare herbs, the cauldron transforms any dead body placed in it into a zombie as if animated by an animate dead spell. Each corpse animated uses up 25 gp in materials per Hit Die, and the cauldron can animate one corpse per round. The user of the cauldron commands the undead so created-up to 12 HD worth, unless the user can cast the animate dead spell, in which case that spell's limit is used; animating more beyond this limit causes earlier specimens to become uncontrolled.
