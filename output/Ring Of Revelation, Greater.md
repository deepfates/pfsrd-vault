Description: A ring of revelation is a divine item attuned to a particular oracular mystery and containing a revelation associated with that mystery (see the [[oracle]] class description). While wearing the ring, an [[oracle]] has access to that revelation and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. The [[oracle]] must have the appropriate mystery to use the ring, and must meet the level requirements (if any) of the revelation itself; for example, a ring of revelation (combat healer) is only usable by an [[oracle]] of at least 7th level with the battle mystery. If the [[oracle]] already has that revelation and the revelation gives an ability with a limited number of uses per day, the [[oracle]] can use that ability one additional time per day. The ring has no effect if worn by a non-[[oracle]]. A lesser ring of revelation contains a revelation that has no level prerequisite or a prerequisite that is less than 6th level. A greater ring of revelation contains a revelation that requires the [[oracle]] to be 7th level or higher. A superior ring of revelation contains a revelation that requires the [[oracle]] to be 11th level or higher.
