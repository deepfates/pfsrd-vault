goal: Be killed or driven insane (as determined by the GM) by an aberration, evil outsider, or undead. This leaves your mind permanently marked.
completion_benefit: Any sane creature that attempts to read your thoughts takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage (Will DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Charisma modified negates). In addition, the effect of any ability damage, ability drain, or penalty to your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is halved (minimum 1). You take a -2 penalty on Will saving throws. Whenever you roll a save against a mind-affecting effect, roll twice and keep the better result.
