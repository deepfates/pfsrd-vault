Name: [[[[Witch]]ing Gown]]
Aura: moderate abjuration
CL: 7
Slot: body
Price: 35,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Spun from combed cotton, this simple, unassuming gown bears a strong aura of [[witch]]craft. These magical garments are highly sought after by [[witch]]es, for though anyone may wear a [[witch]]ing gown, only a [[witch]] may realize its full potential. A [[witch]]ing gown grants its wearer a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws and a +2 competence bonus on all Bluff, Diplomacy, and Intimidate skill checks. When worn by a [[witch]], these bonuses double. In addition, a [[witch]] may change the appearance and style of the gown to match her whims (as the glamered [[armor]] special ability) and adopt virtually any disguise, gaining a +10 bonus on Disguise checks that incorporate the gown's appearance. Only a true seeing spell or similar magic can pierce this effect. Lastly, a [[witch]] may cast a single touch range spell of 4th level or lower into the gown. Thereafter, the gown holds the magic for up to 24 hours, functioning as a spite spell against the next foe to strike the [[witch]] with a successful melee attack or combat maneuver. The gown's spite spell counts as an active spite effect for the [[witch]] wearing the gown.
