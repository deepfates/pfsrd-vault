Description: The members of the Pathfinder Society's administrative body, the Decemvirate, retain their anonymity by wearing close-faced, magically em[[power]]ed helmets while fulfilling their official roles. The helms not only mask the wearers' faces, but also function as helms of telepathy combined with amulets of proof against detection and location. The wearer of a Decemvirate helm can use disguise self at will and benefits from discern lies and true seeing at all times. The helm provides 100% protection from all gaze attacks and all forms of magical control.
