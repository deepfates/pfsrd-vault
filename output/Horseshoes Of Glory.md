Description: These massive horseshoes sport deadly spikes that jut from their front. Once per day on command, the rider of a mount wearing these shoes may choose to either increase the mount's size by one size increment (maximum Huge), or change its type to magical beast, as beast shape IV. In addition, while the mount is augmented in either of these two ways, it gains DR/5 chaos, evil, good, or law (selected by the rider). These horseshoes are part of a set and require all four to be worn by the same animal to properly function.
