Price: 4,000 gp

Description: This talisman is worn lashed around the neck and is made of flexible bark woven into a mesmerizing pattern. While wearing a talisman of beast training, a wearer finds that animals become much more patient with her and amenable to training. As such, failed Handle [[Animal]] checks made during downtime periods- including those made to rear animals and teach them new tricks-may be treated as if they were successful. The talisman can turn 10 failed checks into successes this way. Once the tenth failed check has been converted to a success, the talisman falls apart and becomes useless.
