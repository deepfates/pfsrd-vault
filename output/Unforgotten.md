goal: Find your lost loved one alive, and in the process, decisively defeat a challenging foe who kept you apart.
completion_benefit: You gain a +1 bonus on all saving throws, replacing the +1 bonus on Will saves. If you find your loved one dead, you lose all benefits from this feat until you put the body and possibly soul to proper rest. Putting the body to rest restores the completion benefit, but you don't regain the ability to reduce nonlethal damage.
