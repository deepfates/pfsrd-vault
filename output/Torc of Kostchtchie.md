Name: [[Torc of Kostchtchie]]
Aura: overwhelming conjuration
CL: 25
Slot: neck
Price: 0
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This collar of finely wrought gold is inscribed with all manner of vile runes. It contains a piece of the demon lord Kostchtchie's mortal soul, entrapped by the [[witch]] Baba Yaga. The torc grants its wearer immunity to cold and the ability to command frost giants at will. This ability functions as dominate person, but affects only frost giants, who take a -10 penalty on their saves. In addition, the wearer can cast giant form II three times per day. Anyone who wears the torc for 1 week also gains the ability to summon an aspect of Kostchtchie once per day. This aspect takes the form of an Abyss gigas (see Appendix 2) who faithfully serves the wearer of the torc for 1 hour. Using the torc in this way certainly alerts Kostchtchie to the torc's whereabouts, and the demon lord will not rest until he has recovered the torc. In addition, any time one of the torc's [[power]]s is used, there is a cumulative 5% chance the wearer goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the [[barbarian]]'s rage ability), attacking the nearest non-giant creature until unconscious or dead or until no living non-giant remains within 30 feet.
