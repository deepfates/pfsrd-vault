Name: [[[[Fly]]ing Platform]]
Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 12
Slot: item
Price: 38,000 gp
Weight: 80 lbs.
Description: This sturdy, 10-foot-by-10-foot mithral platform bears five shifting, white runes of Auran incantations related to clouds and swift travel. It functions identically to a carpet of flying, except it requires periodic recharging to maintain [[power]]. The device can hold up to 5 charges, depleting them at a rate of 1 charge for every hour or partial hour of continuous use. The charges can be restored by casting overland flight onto the runes, which restores 1 charge per casting. When in operation, a flying platform also reduces the effect of rushing wind upon those standing on it, producing an alter winds effect to decrease the wind's intensity by one step. A flying platform can normally carry 800 pounds at a speed of 40 feet, but it can carry up to twice this amount with a reduced speed of 30 feet. A flying platform can hover without need for a [[Fly]] check, and grants a +5 bonus on any other [[Fly]] checks made to operate it. It has hardness 10 and 60 hit points.
