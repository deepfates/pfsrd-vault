Name: [[Aligned Horn of Valhalla]]
Aura: strong conjuration
CL: 13
Slot: item
Price: 45,000 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This horn of Valhalla is crafted for service to a cause, whether lofty or profane. Though not intelligent, it has an alignment as determined by the Intelligent Item Alignment table on page 533 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, and summons [[barbarian]]s of that alignment. A character who sounds the horn but is more than one step away from the horn's alignment is attacked by the summoned [[barbarian]]s. The horn's minions also turn against an owner who gives them an order in strong opposition to their ethos, such as ordering lawful good [[barbarian]]s to attack helpless villagers.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], summon monster VI
Cost: 25,000 gp (alignment restriction affects the item's market price, but not the cost to create the item)
