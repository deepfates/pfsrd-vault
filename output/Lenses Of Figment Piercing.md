Name: [[Lenses Of Figment Piercing]]
Aura: faint divination
CL: 3
Slot: eyes
Price: 12,000 gp

Description: When the wearer first sees an illusion effect with the figment subschool with a visual element, and that figment allows a saving throw, she can immediately make any allowed saving throw to realize the image is illusory instead of waiting to interact with it. This has no effect on illusions of other subschools or on illusions that do not normally allow a saving throw. If the wearer fails to disbelieve the illusion and later interacts with it in such a way as to qualify normally for a saving throw to disbelieve, she gains a +4 competence bonus on this saving throw.
