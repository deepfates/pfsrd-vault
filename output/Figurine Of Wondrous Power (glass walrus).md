Name: [[Figurine Of Wondrous Power (glass walrus)]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 14,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This figurine of wondrous [[power]] is shaped like a walrus and is carved out of a prismatic crystal. It follows all the normal rules for figurines of wondrous [[power]] (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 513). When animated, a glass walrus acts in all ways like a normal walrus (see page 29) except it can glide along the surface of water as though under the constant effects of water walk. Up to two [[Medium]] creatures or four Small creatures can fit on a glass walrus's back as the creature glides across water (the walrus moves at half speed while carrying creatures), and the walrus can carry up to 600 pounds in this way before it becomes too encumbered to move. A glass walrus can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the glass walrus again becomes a tiny statuette.
