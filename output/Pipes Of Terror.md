Name: [[Pipes Of Terror]]
Aura: moderate necromancy
CL: 7
Slot: item
Price: 9,000 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: These iron panpipes are warm to the touch and emit a strangely hollow sound when played. When played by a person who succeeds on a DC 15 Perform (wind instruments) check, the pipes create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Those within 30 feet who hear the tune must succeed on a DC 16 Will save or become panicked for 7 rounds. Those who make their save are instead shaken for 1 round. While pipes of terror may be played as often as one chooses, their fear-inducing qualities may only be activated once per day.
