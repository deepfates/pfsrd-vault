Name: [[Snapleaf]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 750 gp
Weight: -
Description: This crystalline carving looks like a hand-sized tree leaf. It is usually worn around the neck on a strap so it is within easy reach, but can be affixed to a belt or clothing just like a badge. Activating a snapleaf is an immediate action and gives the bearer the benefits of feather fall and invisibility. The duration of the two effects work independently; ending one early does not affect the other. The item cannot be activated to provide just one of these two effects; they are always activated simultaneously.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], feather fall, invisibility
Cost: 375 gp
