Description: This +1 ki [[focus]]UE temple swordAPG is gifted to select students from the Monastery of Untwisting Iron in the nation of [[Jalmeray]], though copies have been made by monastic orders across the Inner Sea. Each monastic warden is attuned to a single temple or monastery. A [[monk]] making an attack with this blade can spend 1 ki point as a swift action to ignore any shield bonus to AC her target possesses for that attack. Three times per day, the wielder of the monastic warden can slash the air in his target's direction, causing a shimmering copy of the sword formed of white light to streak toward the target. The wielder must make a ranged touch attack against the target. A creature struck by the shimmering blade takes 4d8 points of damage. If the target is struck while on the grounds of the location the blade is attuned to, the target instead takes 8d6 points of damage and is dazed for 1 round. A successful DC 14 Will saving throw reduces the damage by half and negates the daze effect.
