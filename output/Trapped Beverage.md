Aura: faint conjuration
CL: 3
Slot: item
Price: 300 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This brightly labeled bottle or waterskin could appear to contain any number of different beverages, from absinthe to wine. However, it's actually a magical trap, and when the bottle is opened, a spider swarm (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 258) pours out. The swarm stays in the area for 3 rounds, then disappears. Detecting that the bottle is trapped requires a successful DC 25 Perception check made by a character with the [[trapfinding]] ability, and disabling it requires a successful DC 25 Disable Device check. After being triggered, the trapped beverage remains a mundane bottle or wineskin.
