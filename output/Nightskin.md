Name: [[Nightskin]]
Aura: moderate illusion (evil)
CL: 10
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 53,100 gp
Weight: 25 lbs.
Description: Each of these +2 glamered chain shirts bears a permanent illusion of being a fantastic ebon gown of peerless design or a royal suit of nighted hues. Yet those who see past the illusion find a strange padding within the [[armor]], stitched skins of macabre origins filled with locks of delicate hair, dyed in devil's blood. Those who wear the [[armor]] find that they can see in even the most abysmal darkness as per a devil's ability to see in darkness (seeing through even magical darkness as if it were full light). In addition, the wearer finds that he can understand Infernal perfectly, though the [[armor]] does not grant the ability to speak it. [[Nightskin]] is a fundamentally evil [[armor]] and any wearer of good alignment is treated as being sickened for as long as the [[armor]] is worn.
