Name: [[Cornucopia Of Plenty]]
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 35,000 gp
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This large container, crafted from an animal horn or woven of wicker, overflows with fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Up to three times per day, it can be inverted to pour forth delicious food equal to a casting of create food and water for up to six people. Though the cornucopia produces no water, the succulent fruits slake normal thirst. If the user expends one use of mythic [[power]] when inverting the horn, it instead produces a heroes' feast that also refreshes the partakers as though they had rested for a full 8 hours sleep. Creatures with the recuperation ability (see page 12) who dine on this feast recover as though they had rested for the hour required by the recuperation ability, with no need to expend additional uses of mythic [[power]]. Eating more than one such feast within a single day provides no additional benefit.
