name: [[Thuvia]]n Grenadier
type: General
description: Training with alchemically inclined allies helps you avoid friendly fire.
prerequisites: [[Precise Shot]] or [[Throw Anything]].
prerequisite_feats: [[Precise Shot]] or [[Throw Anything]]
benefit: Whenever you hit a creature with a splash weapon, you may choose to exclude one creature within the weapon's splash area from taking splash damage. If a creature within the splash area also has this feat, it automatically ignores splash damage from your splash weapons on a successful hit. In addition, if you miss with a splash weapon and the errant weapon lands in a square occupied or adjacent to an ally with this feat, your ally can attempt a DC 20 Ref lex save. If the ally succeeds, he is able to catch the weapon. If your ally also has the [[[[Snatch]] Arrows]] feat, he can toss the splash weapon back to you as an immediate action.
