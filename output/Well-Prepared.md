name: [[Well-Prepared]]
type: General
description: Somehow, you always seem to have the right tools or supplies close at hand.
prerequisites: Halfling.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: Once per day, when confronted with a situation that calls for a particular mundane item of equipment, you may make a Sleight of Hand check with a DC of 10 plus the item's cost in gold pieces to "happen" to have such an item on your person. For example, having a crowbar would be DC 12, whereas a flask of acid would be DC 20. The item must be something you can easily carry-if you are on foot and have only a backpack, for example, you could not have a large iron cauldron. You cannot have magical items using this feat, nor can you have specif ic items, such as the key to a particular door. If you are stripped of your equipment or possessions, you lose the benef its of this feat until you have at least a day to resupply and "acquire" new items. You must pay for these items normally.
