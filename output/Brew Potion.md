name: [[Brew Potion]]
type: Item Creation
description: You can create magic potions.
prerequisites: Caster level 3rd.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you know and that targets one or more creatures or objects. Brewing a potion takes 2 hours if its base price is 250 gp or less, otherwise brewing a potion takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must be sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own level. To brew a potion, you must use up raw materials costing one half this base price. See the magic item creation rules in Chapter 15 for more information. When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the target of the spell.
