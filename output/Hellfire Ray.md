description: A blast of hellfire blazes from your hands. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to deal damage to the target.  The ray deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 15d6). Half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from unholy [[power]] and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks.  Any creature killed by this spell must make a Will saving throw; failure means the creature's soul is damned to Hell as a burst of brimstone appears around its corpse. A non-evil spellcaster attempting to bring the character back from the dead must make a caster level check (DC equal to 10 plus the slain creature's level) to succeed; failure means the spellcaster cannot try again for 1 day. Evil spellcasters can raise the slain character normally, without a check.
