Description: This golden amulet is used by religious sects as a way to help the faithful capture fugitives or defend themselves without doing undue harm to potential converts. While the wearer is using her divine [[power]]s of retribution (such as a [[cleric]]'s smite, an [[inquisitor]]'s smiting judgment, or a [[paladin]]'s smite), the amulet grants her the ability to make unarmed strikes in melee combat as if she had the [[Improved Unarmed Strike]] feat.
