Name: [[Haunted Shoes]]
Aura: faint conjuration and illusion
CL: 3
Slot: feet
Price: 6,480 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Two times per day, the wearer of these shoes can call forth 1d4 spirit servants to aid her. The spirit servants are invisible, mindless, shapeless beings that act as servants summoned by the unseen servant spell. The [[spirits]] return to the shoes after 3 hours have passed. The wearer can choose to dismiss one or more of the spirit servants early. Once per day, the wearer can command the ghostly [[spirits]] inside her haunted shoes to emerge and swirl [[around her]], making her difficult to target in combat. The wearer gains concealment (20% miss chance) for 3 minutes. The [[spirits]] cannot be harmed, but a true seeing spell ignores the concealment effect. The concealment effect cannot be activated while any of the [[spirits]] are currently being used as unseen servants.
