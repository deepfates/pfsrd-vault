Description: The wearer of these slippers may walk on air (as the spell air walk) for up to 10 minutes per day, which may be used in 1-minute increments and requires no action to activate. However, she may only walk on air within or on top of natural or magical mist or fog, including fog-like gases such as those created by acid fog, cloudkill, incendiary cloud, or stinking cloud.
