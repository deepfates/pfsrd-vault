Name: [[Goz Mask]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 8
Slot: head
Price: 8,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Shortly after the Eye of Abendego began, a fanatical splinter-cult of [[Gozreh]] known as the Storm Kindlers flocked to the region, convinced the Eye was a manifestation of the Storm Lord himself. The upper tier of this group created enchanted masks to aid in the navigation of the often storm-lashed swamps. The Storm Kindlers, however, were unprepared for the savagery and evil that had claimed the Sodden Lands, and they and their home were quickly wiped out. Today, many of these distinctive masks remain, now worn by humanoid chieftains and Koboto [[witch]] doctors. The masks are often defaced, with the original appearance twisted into a monstrous or demonic visage. Their new owners refer to them as goz masks. A goz mask allows you to see through fog, smoke, and other obscuring vapors as if they did not exist (this ability functions underwater as well, allowing the wearer to see through thick silt and other aquatic precipitates). Additionally, you are treated as one size category larger than you are and gain a +4 bonus on all saving throws made to resist the effects of wind while wearing a goz mask. A goz mask allows its wearer to breathe water for 1 hour per day-these minutes need not be consecutive, but must be expended in minimum increments of 10 minutes each.
