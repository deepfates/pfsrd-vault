Name: [[[[Sihedron]] Ring]]
Aura: moderate abjuration and illusion
CL: 9
Slot: ring
Price: 35,000 gp
Weight: -
Description: This otherwise plain ring is adorned with a tiny [[Sihedron]] rune. These rings were given to agents and allies of the runelords as badges of office and tokens of appreciation for their work-sometimes, they were given as bribes to those a runelord was attempting to win to his cause. Like the more common [[Sihedron]] medallion, runelords have special links to [[Sihedron]] rings that aid in scrying and observation of the [[world]] around the wearer of the ring. A [[Sihedron]] ring grants a +3 deflection bonus to AC, a +3 resistance bonus on all saving throws, and protects the wearer with a constant endure elements effect. At will, as a standard action, the wearer can use the [[Sihedron]] ring to change the appearance of his clothing or [[armor]] into any other kind of clothing or [[armor]]. The actual clothing and [[armor]] worn retain all their properties (including weight) when glamered. Only true seeing or similar magic reveals the true nature of the adornments.
