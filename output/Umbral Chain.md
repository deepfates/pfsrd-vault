Name: [[Umbral Chain]]
Aura: strong evocation
CL: 13
Slot: item
Price: 8,825 gp
Weight: 10 lbs.
Description: This bloodstained spiked chain has a large handle-ring that glows a pale violet color when wielded in normal light. An umbral chain grows more potent in darkness. It acts as a +1 spiked chain when in dim light. In darkness, it acts as a +2 spiked chain. When surrounded by supernatural darkness (such as in an area of deeper darkness), it acts as a +2 spiked chain and grants the wielder the [[Blind-Fight]] feat. In daylight or bright illumination, the weapon temporarily loses all its magical enhancement bonuses and is effectively a masterwork weapon, though it resumes its magical functions once it's no longer in bright light. The violet glow from the weapon dims in response to ambient light, vanishing completely in darkness or supernatural darkness.
