Name: [[Figurines Of Wondrous Power (slate Spider)]]
Aura: Moderate transmutation
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 10,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Each of the several kinds of figurines of wondrous [[power]] appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak. If a figurine of wondrous [[power]] is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its [[power]] departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. This statuette of a spider with stubby legs can be used once per day for 1 minute. When activated, the figurine sprouts longer, segmented legs, and scampers about the bearer, picking lint off robes, chiseling grime from [[armor]], or otherwise grooming the bearer. If commanded to do so (a free action), it perches on the muzzle of a one-handed or two-handed firearm barrel and, after the firearm is fired, travels down the barrel and cleans out the firearm. Each time the slate spider cleans a firearm, the next shot the firearm fires has no chance of misfiring.
