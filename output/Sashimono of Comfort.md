Slot: item
Price: 2,400 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: A sashimono of comfort is a purple Tian silk banner, typically 3 feet tall and 1 foot wide, decorated with three stylized orchid flowers. The banner is attached to a lance, polearm, staff, or frame, which can be worn on the back of a creature, carried by a mounted creature, flown from a wagon, or planted in the ground. A sashimono of comfort keeps creatures comfortable in extreme weather conditions. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground. When worn or carried by a creature, the banner grants the effects of endure elements to the bearer. When carried by a mounted creature, it grants both mount and rider this benefit. If it is flown from a wagon, the wagon's driver, passengers, and draft team all gain this benefit. If planted firmly in the ground, the banner grants this benefit to all creatures within 30 feet. In addition, a caravan equipped with a sashimono of comfort gains a +2 bonus on Security checks to resist the effects of severe weather. These effects function at temperatures between -50° and 140° F. If conditions are beyond these extremes, creatures using a sashimono of comfort treat the ambient temperature as if it were 50° F warmer or cooler respectively, thereby possibly allowing additional castings of endure elements to work normally.
