Name: [[Nine-Fold Spirit Sword]]
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 28,800 gp
Weight: 4 lbs.
Description: This broad-bladed +1 ghost touch nine-ring broadsword (Ultimate Combat 131, or use longsword) is crafted of silvery-gray steel, with nine golden rings threaded through its spine that glow with magical [[power]]. Streamers of blue and purple silk hang from the sword's pommel. The nine-fold spirit sword has 9 charges, represented by its nine rings. As a swift action, the wielder can discharge the energy in these rings to create one of three effects. By expending 1 charge, the wielder can add the undead bane special ability to the sword for 1 minute. By expending 2 charges, the wielder can attempt to banish a creature possessing another creature (such as a ghost possessing a creature with its malevolence ability) with a successful hit on the possessed creature. The possessing creature must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be driven out of the body of the creature it is possessing. By expending 3 charges, the wielder can attempt to destroy a single undead creature with a successful hit. The creature must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or be utterly destroyed. Spell resistance does not apply against either the banishing or destruction effect. Each ring holds 1 charge; when a charge is expended, one ring stops glowing. The sword recharges 1 charge per week.
