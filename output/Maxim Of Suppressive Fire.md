Name: [[Maxim Of Suppressive Fire]]
Aura: strong conjuration
CL: 13
Slot: item
Price: 33,800 gp
Weight: 140 lbs.
Description: The bullets fired by this +2 Maxim M1910 machine gun (see page 65) are enhanced to pierce protective cover, allowing the wielder to ignore the AC bonus granted to targets by anything less than total cover. A Maxim of suppressive fire can make attacks against targets with total cover, but the wielder must still guess the correct square of its target's location, and the target still benefits from total concealment (50% miss chance).
