Description: This blood-red devil talisman binds a barbazu. Wearing the talisman grants you a +3 profane bonus to your Armor Class and grants you a telepathic bond with the devil bound within. Once per day, you can make an opposed Charisma check against the barbazu's +0 modifier to summon him forth for 8 rounds, as per the spell summon monster. The barbazu bound within this sanguine talisman is known as Kalvaddas the [[Strangler]]. He is a blunt sadist with a love of handto- hand brawls and strangling elves. He knows much of liars and might use his Sense Motive skill to aid a master he favors.
