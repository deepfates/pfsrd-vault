description: Your summoned natural allies ignore difficult terrain in undergrowth.
prerequisites: Augmented Summoning, [[Spell Focus]] (conjuration), caster level 6th.
prerequisite_feats: Augmented Summoning, [[Spell Focus]] (conjuration)
benefit: Creatures you summon with summon nature's ally can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, and similar terrain) at their normal speeds without taking damage or suffering other impairment. Thorns, briars, and undergrowth areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect the summoned creatures.
