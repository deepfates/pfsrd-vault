Name: [[Icon Of Aspects]]
Aura: moderate evocation
CL: 7
Slot: item
Price: 5,500 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: When a [[cleric]] with an icon of aspects prepares spells, she may replace the granted [[power]]s of one of her domains with those of a different domain she doesn't have but that is associated with her deity. This lasts until the next time she prepares spells. The [[cleric]] must meet the level requirements for both abilities. For example, a 6th-level [[cleric]] with the Good domain who swaps for the [[Heal]]ing domain can't use healer's blessing even though she meets the level requirement, because the holy lance [[power]] of the Good domain requires her to be 8th level. The icon affects only granted [[power]]s, not domain spells, bonus feats, or other benefits. The icon can affect only one person at a time.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], imbue with spell ability, creator must be a divine spellcaster
