Name: [[Book Thief's Satchel]]
Aura: moderate conjuration and divination
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 10,000 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: Often used by spies and arcane scholars to steal important texts without alerting their owners, a book thief's satchel contains enough room to hold a single tome of no more than 1,000 pages and no larger than 12 by 18 inches in size. Prior to using the satchel, its bearer must place a blank book in the satchel and utter a command word. This blank book is sequestered in an extradimensional space accessible only upon command. (A typical blank, 50-page journal costs 10 gp.) Once per day, when another book, folio, scroll, or other text is placed within the satchel while a blank book is hidden within the extradimensional space, the pages of the newly added book are wiped blank (though the covers and bindings remain unchanged). The entire contents of this book or scroll appear on the pages of the blank book in the satchel's extradimensional pocket. The transfer takes 1 full round, and if the process is interrupted, such as by either book being removed or the satchel being significantly damaged, the text being copied is lost forever. If the blank book is smaller in size (in number of pages for a book or number of inches for a scroll) than the book to be stolen, the satchel doesn't transfer the contents, and the text being copied is lost forever. A book thief's satchel can't transfer magical writing (such as the pages of a [[wizard]]'s spellbook, a magical scroll, or a wondrous item). Attempts to do so fail immediately, neither erasing the book to be copied nor copying any of the pages to the blank book.
