name: [[Serpent Lash]]
type: Combat
description: You are adept at vexing multiple foes with your whip.
prerequisites: [[Weapon Finesse]], proficient in whip.
prerequisite_feats: [[Weapon Finesse]]
benefit: As a standard action, you can make a disarm or trip maneuver with your whip. If it succeeds, you can make an additional disarm or trip maneuver with the same bonus against a target adjacent to the first and also within your whip's reach. In addition, you can use your whip to perform reposition maneuvers, though you take a -4 penalty on your CMB and you may only move the target toward you from its original position. This feat originally appeared in Pathfinder Campaign Setting: [[Osirion]], Land of the Pharaohs.
