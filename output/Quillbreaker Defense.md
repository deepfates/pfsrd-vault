prerequisites: Proficiency with [[armor]] spikes.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: If you are wearing [[armor]] spikes, as an immediate action when you take damage from a nonmagical attack, you can give your [[armor]] spikes the broken condition to reduce the amount of damage you take by 5. If your [[armor]] spikes are already broken, they are destroyed when you take the damage. If you are wearing masterwork [[armor]] spikes, you instead reduce the damage taken by 10.
