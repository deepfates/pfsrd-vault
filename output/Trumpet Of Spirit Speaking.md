Name: [[Trumpet Of Spirit Speaking]]
Aura: moderate necromancy
CL: 6
Slot: item
Price: 6,500 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This long, segmented cone is made of a lightweight metal and collapses into three sections. Although nonmagical spirit trumpets are most often used by fraudulent mediums and manipulated with sleight of hand and ventriloquism, a trumpet of spirit speaking allows actual communication with the [[spirits]] of the deceased. Once per day, when its mouthpiece is placed to the lips of a mostly intact corpse, the user can ask up to three questions of the dead creature, as if the corpse were subject to a speak with dead spell. The corpse's replies to the questions issue forth from the horn in quiet, ghostly whispers.
