[[Destruction]]: If [[Briar]] is claimed by the nymph Nyrissa-of whom it is fundamentally a part-the blade gradually begins rejoining with the fey queen. If left in Nyrissa's possession, [[Briar]] fades out of existence over the course of a week. At the end of this time, the weapon is destroyed and Nyrissa regains her ability to love. Only one of the fey lords known as the Eldest can restore [[Briar]] once Nyrissa has reclaimed it.
