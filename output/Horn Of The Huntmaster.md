Name: [[Horn Of The [[Huntmaster]]]]
Aura: moderate enchantment
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 5,000 gp
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This elongated bull's horn curves sharply at the end, almost making it seem more like an enormous smoking pipe than a tool for the hunt. Once each day, a person with the hunter's bond (companions) class feature may blow the horn as a standard action; this grants his full favored enemy bonus (instead of half) against a single target to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. The effect lasts for 1 minute.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], greater heroism
Cost: 2,500 gp
