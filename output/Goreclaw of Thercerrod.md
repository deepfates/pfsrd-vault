Name: [[Goreclaw of Thercerrod]]
Aura: moderate evocation
CL: 10
Slot: hands
Price: 23,305 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: These leather gauntlets and bracers are trimmed, backed, and studded with metal, and yellowed bear claws cap each of the fingers. Although it incorporates metal, use of the goreclaw does not violate a [[druid]]'s prohibition against wearing metal [[armor]]. The goreclaw of Thercerrod is a +2 wounding spiked gauntlet. If worn by a [[druid]] while wild shaping, the [[druid]] retains the +2 enhancement bonus and the wounding weapon property for any natural claw attack she gains during the transformation. Any effect that would improve or enhance such natural attacks suppresses the magic of the goreclaw for the duration of the effect.
Requirements: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], bleed, greater magic fang
