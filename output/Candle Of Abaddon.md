Name: [[Candle Of Abaddon]]
Aura: strong necromancy and abjuration
CL: 13
Slot: item
Price: 9,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Molded from a pale, milky green wax into the shape of a column of screaming souls, and stamped on the bottom with the unholy symbol of one of the Four Horsemen, the candle of Abaddon is a boon to evil spellcasters, but also to any who would summon or interact with daemons. When burned, the candle sheds eerie illumination in a radius of 15 feet, similar to Abaddon's perpetual eclipse. A spellcaster within the radius of the burning candle gains a +2 bonus to caster level when casting spells with the evil descriptor. The light also acts as a magic circle against evil, but only against daemons. Within the light, all creatures take 1 point of damage per round, natural healing doesn't work, and magical healing requires a DC 24 caster level check to succeed. A candle normally burns for 4 hours, and any burning consumes at least 1 minute of its [[power]]. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like. Doing this doesn't interfere with its magical properties.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], magic circle against evil, desecrate, creator must be evil
Cost: 4,500 gp.
