Description: Five faceted sapphires decorate this ornate headband. The headband protects the wearer from effects that would damage his mental capacity. After wearing the headband for 24 hours, the wearer gains five temporary ability points. These points do not add to the wearer's ability scores and do not grant a bonus to any roll. Any damage or drain to a mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) taken by the wearer is subtracted from these points first. Damage or drain in excess of the wearer's temporary ability points is applied to his current ability scores as normal. The wearer immediately loses all temporary ability points upon removing the headband. In addition, the headband grants the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. It also grants skill ranks as a headband of vast intelligence +2. Temporary ability points that are lost to ability damage return after 24 hours. Ability points lost to ability drain are lost permanently.
