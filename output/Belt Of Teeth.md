Name: [[Belt Of Teeth]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 1
Slot: belt
Price: 4,000 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: The brass buckle on this stout leather belt is fashioned to resemble three demonic faces. Once each round, this belt's buckle can animate, lashing out at a creature that provokes an attack of opportunity within 5 feet. This attack uses its wearer's base attack bonus and Strength modifier, with a +4 competence bonus. It deals damage as a bite attack made by a creature of its wearer's size (1d6 for a [[Medium]] wearer; see Table 3-1: Natural Attacks by Size, Bestiary 302) plus the wearer's Strength modifier. This belt does not add to the normal number of attacks the wearer can make in a round; it offers another way in which to make attacks of opportunity.
