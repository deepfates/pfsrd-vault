Name: [[Fiendsplitter]]
Aura: moderate conjuration and evocation
CL: 7
Slot: item
Price: 28,715 gp
Weight: 6 lbs.
Description: This sturdy weapon acts as a +1 demon-bane battleaxe and constantly emits a susurrus of faint, overlapping voices. In the presence of demons, the murmur of voices increases to a cacophony of angry cries. These voices are individually unintelligible; the item communicates by empathy rather than speech because its intelligence is a collection of several dozen essences rather than a single [[power]]ful personality. The battleaxe has the destruction of demons as its special purpose and the dedicated [[power]] to detect demons within 60 feet, even when the demons are hidden or in disguise. [[Fiendsplitter]] is embossed with the symbol of [[Torag]] and can be used as a holy symbol by followers of that stern god. Three times per day, [[Fiendsplitter]] can imbue itself with bless weapon. Additionally, to combat the foul poisons and life-sapping [[power]]s employed by many demons, [[Fiendsplitter]] can affect its wielder with lesser restoration three times per day.
Requirements: Craft Arms and Armor, bless weapon, lesser restoration, summon monster I
