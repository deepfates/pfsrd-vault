Name: [[MolvÃ«nn]]
Aura: strong necromancy and transmutation
CL: 15
Slot: item
Price: 63,312 gp
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This heavy warhammer is capped with steel spikes on both ends of its massive head, and a leather thong prevents it from falling from the wielder's hand. Molv&#235;nn is a +3 warhammer that deals both piercing and bludgeoning damage. Yet although it is already a formidable weapon, its true potential is only realized in the hands of a [[barbarian]]. Wielded by a [[barbarian]], Molv&#235;nn becomes a +5 thundering warhammer. The [[barbarian]] gains an additional 1 hit point per [[barbarian]] level when raging and can add twice her Strength modifier (instead of half again her Strength modifier) to damage rolls while wielding Molv&#235;nn two-handed. Additionally, while Molv&#235;nn's wielder is raging, she cannot be disarmed, nor can Molv&#235;nn be sundered.
