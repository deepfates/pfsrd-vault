Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This metal headdress is shaped like a falcon's head and enameled in brilliant colors. Originally crafted for a [[wizard]] dedicated to Horus as a reward from his pharaoh for his prowess on the battlefield, the falcon crown was believed lost when the [[wizard]] was struck down by an ancient blue dragon. Centuries later, however, archaeologists discovered the falcon crown among the ruins of Tumen. Researcher-priests of [[Nethys]] acquired the crown shortly after, and when the [[Nethys]]ian priestess Serethet became the Forgotten Pharaoh, she claimed the falcon crown for herself. The wearer of the falcon crown gains a +2 insight bonus to her Armor Class. In addition, up to three times per day as an immediate action, the wearer of the falcon crown can sacrifice a prepared spell or unused spell slot of 1st level or higher and transform it into a damaging ray, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This ray deals 1d4 points of damage for every level of the spell or spell slot sacrificed. A non-spellcaster cannot create rays with the falcon crown, but can still gain the AC bonus.
