Description: [[Riftcarver]] is an immense weapon carved from exoskeleton plates pried from the body of the now-long-forgotten monstrosity that birthed Deskari into the Abyss. The demon lord emerged fully formed, and the crafting of this weapon was among the first of his acts-[[Riftcarver]] aided the demon lord tremendously in those first few thousand centuries of his life, and was the primary tool he used to dig the Rasping Rifts. [[Riftcarver]] is a Gargantuan +5 defending unholy wounding scythe. As part of its first successful hit against a target in any one round, [[Riftcarver]] can infest the creature hit with rot grubs (Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide 245). Once per minute as a standard action by striking at the ground, [[Riftcarver]] can create an earthquake centered on the target's location. [[Riftcarver]]'s wielder never suffers any ill effects from earthquakes created by the scythe. Once per day, the scythe can be swept through the air as a standard action to rip a hole between [[world]]s that serves as a 20-foot-diameter gate-this gate can be used only for planar travel, not for calling creatures. [[Riftcarver]] is made of the chitin of an Abyssal monster, yet it is treated as adamantine for the purposes of damaging objects and penetrating hardness. Smaller versions of this artifact, built to be used by [[Medium]] cultists, also exist. Called rotcarvers, the majority of these weapons have been captured and destroyed by the crusaders by the Fifth Crusade. A rotcarver is a +3 scythe that can infest those it strikes with rot grubs, or can transform its user into a rot grub swarm. [[Rotcarver]]s are detailed on page 51 of Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Lost Kingdoms.
