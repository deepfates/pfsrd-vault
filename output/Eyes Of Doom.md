Description: These crystal lenses fit over the user's eyes, enabling him to cast doom upon those around him (one target per round) as a gaze attack, except that the wearer must take a standard action, and those merely looking at the wearer are not affected. Those failing a DC 11 Will save are affected as by the doom spell. The wearer also gains the additional [[power]] of a continual deathwatch effect and can use fear (Will DC 16 partial) as a normal gaze attack once per week. Both lenses must be worn for the magic item to take effect.
