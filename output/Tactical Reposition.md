name: [[Tactical Reposition]]
type: Combat
description: You excel at moving foes right where you want them.
prerequisites: Int 13, Combat [[Expert]]ise, [[Improved Reposition]]APG.
prerequisite_feats: Combat [[Expert]]ise, [[Improved Reposition]]
benefit: When making a reposition combat maneuver (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 322), you can move an enemy into a trap or other hazardous area, such as a pit, wall scythe, or blade barrier. When you do so, the moved enemy is treated as though it had activated the trap or triggered the hazard, and it takes a -2 penalty to AC and on saving throws to mitigate the trap or hazard's effects.
normal: You cannot reposition a foe into an intrinsically dangerous space such as a pit or blade barrier.
