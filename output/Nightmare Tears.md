Description: [[Nightmare]] tears are a toxic alchemical solution that, when applied to the eyes, allows the individual to see past certain supernatural effects, as the spell true seeing. These include reality-warping effects such as those caused by the Plateau of Leng and spells or supernatural [[power]]s that create phantasms such as weird, nightmare, and phantasmal killer. The effect of the tears lasts for 1 hour. [[Nightmare]] tears have horrific side effects-users suffer both temporary blindness and insanity. Immediately after applying the tears, the user goes blind for 1d4 rounds and looses 1d4 points of Wisdom until the tears wear off. However, if the user fails a DC 11 Will save, both effects become permanent.
