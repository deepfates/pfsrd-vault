Name: [[Warden Of The Woods]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 11
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 29,350 gp
Weight: 25 lbs.
Description: The warden of the woods is a suit of +3 greenwood splint mail made of strips of laminated greenwood that flex with the wearer's movement but stiffen when struck in battle. (The greenwood special material is described on page 50.) This [[armor]] is treated in all ways like medium [[armor]], including when determining proficiency. The [[armor]] has an arcane spell failure chance of 25%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +2, and an [[armor]] check penalty of -4. As a move action, the wearer can snap a strip of wood loose from the [[armor]]. The strip lengthens into a weapon of a type chosen by the [[armor]]'s wearer. It can become a +1 greenwood club, a +1/+1 greenwood quarterstaff, or a +1 keen greenwood wooden stake. If the wearer creates a club or quarterstaff in this way, it gains the benefits of the shillelagh spell with a duration of 1 minute. Each weapon removed from the warden of the woods reduces the [[armor]]'s enhancement bonus by 1. Consequently, a maximum of three such weapons can be separated from the [[armor]] at any given time. The greenwood weapons keep their enhancement bonuses only while they're in the wearer's hands, though they remain masterwork weapons for other wielders. The wearer can reintegrate a weapon back into the warden of the woods as a move action and restore the lost enhancement bonus. Each day at dawn, the [[armor]] regenerates any missing strips (regaining its full enhancement bonus), and any weapons still detached from the [[armor]] crumble into dust.
