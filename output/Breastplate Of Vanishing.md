Name: [[Breastplate Of Vanishing]]
Aura: faint conjuration
CL: 5
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 15,200 gp
Weight: 15 lbs.
Description: This battered +1 mithral breastplate bears a resemblance to a stylized turtle shell. On command, its wearer can vanish inside the [[armor]], leaving the breastplate behind while she stays safely hidden in an extradimensional space. This space is barely large enough for the wearer to sit comfortably, but does provides breathable air and light to see by. The wearer cannot perceive the environs around the [[armor]] while inside. A second command word returns the wearer to the [[armor]]'s location, wearing the [[armor]]. If the wearer can't return to the space the [[armor]] is in, she is instead shunted to the nearest empty space that can contain her, but no longer wearing the [[armor]]. If the breastplate is destroyed, the wearer immediately returns to the square the [[armor]] was in when it was destroyed. Successfully dispelling the [[armor]] likewise returns the wearer, though in this case still wearing the [[armor]].
