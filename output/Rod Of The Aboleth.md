Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 7
Slot: item

Description: The rod of the aboleth acts as a +1 corrosive light mace. One end of the rod has three eye-shaped rubies imbedded in it, while the other end comes to a sharp point. When exposed to moisture, the surface of the rod takes on a slimy sheen that doesn't affect the wielder's grip. This rod has the following [[power]]s. • Once per day as a free action, when the rod hits a living creature, the target must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw or take 1d4 points of Constitution damage. • Once per day as a free action, when the rod hits a living creature, the creature must succeed at a DC 13 Will saving throw or be affected as though targeted with a aboleth's lung spell (Advanced Race Guide). • On command for 1 minute per day, the wielder may gain a swim speed of 60 feet for 1 minute. This time need not be continuous, and can be spent in 1-round increments.
