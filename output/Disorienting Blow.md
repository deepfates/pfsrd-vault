name: [[Disorienting Blow]]
type: Combat
description: When you successfully strike your opponent with your [[Stunning Fist]], you leave it in a state of confusion.
prerequisites: [[Stunning Fist]], base attack bonus +11.
prerequisite_feats: [[Stunning Fist]]
benefit: You must choose to use this ability before making an attack roll with your [[Stunning Fist]], and this effect replaces other effects or conditions that would be caused by [[Stunning Fist]]. If you successfully hit your opponent and it fails its Fortitude save, it becomes confused for 1 round. Additional disorienting blows to the confused target add to the duration of its confusion. This feat is otherwise subject to all of the limits and conditions of [[Stunning Fist]].
