name: [[Spellsong]]
type: General
description: You can blend the [[power]] of your performance and spellcasting.
prerequisites: Cha 13, [[bard]]ic performance class ability, able to cast 1st-level spells.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: You can combine your [[bard]]ic performance and your spellcasting in two ways. First, you can conceal the activity of casting a [[bard]] spell by masking it in a performance. As a swift action, you may combine your casting time of a spell with a Perform check. Observers must make a Perception or Sense Motive check opposed by your Perform check to realize you are also casting a spell. This uses 1 round of your [[bard]]ic performance ability, regardless of the spell's casting time. Second, as a move action, you can use 1 round of [[bard]]ic performance to maintain a [[bard]] spell with a duration of concentration. You can cast another spell in the same round you are using [[bard]]ic magic to maintain concentration; if you do this, your concentration on the maintained spell ends when you end the [[bard]]ic performance the spell is part of.
