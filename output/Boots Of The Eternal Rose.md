Name: [[Boots Of The Eternal Rose]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 3
Slot: feet
Price: 4,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: These leather boots are found in a variety of styles but always have a prominent engraving of a rose. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on Perform (dance) and Stealth checks. The wearer may move through areas of flowers (whether wild-growing or a garden) at normal speed and without suffering any impairment or taking damage from thorns, brambles, or similar hazards; areas of flowers that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect the wearer. If [[Shelyn]] is the wearer's patron, the wearer may use daze monster once per day; if the wearer is dancing, singing, or using some other Perform skill as part of a performance lasting at least 1 minute, he may activate daze monster as a free action during his performance. As a free action once per round, the wearer may conjure a beautiful, nonmagical, common flower (such as a daisy, pansy, rose, sunflower, or the like) that lasts for 1 day before crumbling into perfume and dust.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], daze monster, pass without trace, creator must have 5 ranks in Perform (dance) and Stealth
