Description: This shepherd's crook is formed of alternating bands of ivory and obsidian around a sycamore shaft. Golden runes run the length of the staff, twisting into new configurations as its various [[power]]s are used. The staff of the scholar has all the [[power]]s of a regular staff of the magi plus the following abilities: contact other plane (2 charges), legend lore (2 charges), and scrying (2 charges). If the wielder of the staff of the scholar uses its retributive strike ability and successfully travels to another plane of existence, he always arrives in the abode of a god of knowledge (though not necessarily a friendly one).
