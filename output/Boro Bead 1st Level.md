Description: This multicolored, sturdy glass bead is an aid to members of the [[alchemist]] class. Once per day on command, a boro bead enables the bearer to recharge any one extract that he had mixed and then consumed that day. The extract is then reconstituted and usable again, just as if it had not been drank. The extract must be of a particular level, depending on the bead. Different beads exist for recalling one extract per day of each level from 1st through 6th. A bead works on an infusion, but not a potion, elixir, bomb, mutagen, or nonmagical alchemical material such as antitoxin.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], creator must be able to prepare extracts of the extract level to be recalled
