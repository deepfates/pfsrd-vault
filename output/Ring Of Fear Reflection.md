Price: 48,000 gp
Weight: -
Description: This simple silver ring has a fear rune etched into its hammered apex. The ring provides a morale bonus versus fear effects. This bonus starts at +0 and can advance no higher than +5. Every time the wearer succeeds at a Will save versus a fear affect, the ring's bonus increases by +1. Should the wearer fail a Will save versus fear, the ring's bonus immediately falls to +0. If the bonus is +5 and the wearer is affected by a fear effect and succeeds at her Will save, the ring automatically reflects the fear effect back to its source. If the source is a creature not immune to fear, it must succeed at a Will save at the DC made by the ring's wearer or be affected by the fear effect. Only the source of an area fear effect is targeted by such a reflected spell.
