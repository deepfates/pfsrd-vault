name: [[[[Shield]] Snag]]
type: Combat
description: You know how to navigate your shield around weapons and can use it to keep your balance.
prerequisites: [[Improved [[Shield]] Bash]], [[[[Shield]] Proficiency]], [[Two-Weapon Fighting]], base attack bonus +6.
prerequisite_feats: [[Improved [[Shield]] Bash]], [[[[Shield]] Proficiency]], [[Two-Weapon Fighting]]
benefit: Any opponents hit by your shield bash are also targeted by a free disarm attempt, substituting your attack roll for the combat maneuver check. This disarm attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity. You cannot use this ability during the same round as a bull rush attempt made with [[[[Shield]] Slam]] or with any other abilities that affect how your shield bash works. When using a shield, you gain a +4 bonus on Strength checks to avoid being blown away by a strong wind and on Climb checks to catch yourself on a wall or slope when falling.
