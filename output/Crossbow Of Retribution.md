Description: This +1 human bane seeking repeating heavy crossbow is carved from whalebone decorated with green and gold lacquer, with fittings, lever, and bow of gilded steel. On a successful hit against any creature who has just struck the wielder with an attack within the previous round-whether with a melee, ranged, or natural weapon, or a spell that requires an attack roll-ammunition fired from a crossbow of retribution wracks the target with shooting pains that impose a -4 penalty on attack rolls, skills checks, and ability checks for 7 rounds. On a successful DC 14 Fortitude save, the penalty only lasts for 1 round. A target who worships the same god as the wielder takes a -2 penalty on its saving throw.
Requirements: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], retribution (Pathfinder RPG Advanced Player's Guide 239), summon monster I, true seeing
