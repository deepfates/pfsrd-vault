Description: This dirt-stained cloak was woven in shadow from the burial shroud of a condemned murderer. It prevents nonintelligent undead from detecting you, as per the hide from undead spell. Intelligent undead can perceive you if they succeed at a DC 11 Will save. The warding is ended if you touch an undead creature, channel energy against undead, or attack any creature. Once per day as a standard action you can silently call forth the shadows bound into the shroud, rendering you invisible for 5 minutes.
