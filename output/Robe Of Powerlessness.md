Description: A robe of [[power]]lessness appears to be a magic robe of another sort. As soon as a character dons this garment, she takes a -10 penalty to Strength, as well as to Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma, forgetting spells and magic knowledge accordingly. If the character is a spellcaster, the robe targets the character's primary spellcasting score, otherwise it targets Intelligence. The robe can be removed easily, but in order to restore mind and body, the character must receive a remove curse spell followed by heal.
