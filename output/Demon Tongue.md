Removing the recipient's tongue deals 2d6 points of damage to the recipient and prevents it from speaking until the demon tongue is implanted. Once attached, a demon tongue grants the recipient a +4 profane bonus on Bluff checks used to verbally lie or deceive. A demon tongue also grants its recipient a portion of a demon's immunity to poison. A creature with a demon tongue implanted gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made to resist an ingested poison. In addition, the creature can detect the presence of an ingested poison in anything it eats or drinks as the detect poison spell.
