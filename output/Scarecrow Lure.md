Description: This life-sized scarecrow is garbed in old clothing and [[armor]]. At its center is the real skeleton of a former adventurer. A scarecrow lure is enchanted to writhe and cry out for help as if wounded. The lure's voice is usually that of the adventurer whose remains are inside, though the creator may choose any voice when creating the item. Anyone who hears or sees a scarecrow lure can attempt a DC 11 Will save to disbelieve the effect. Activating a scarecrow lure is a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
