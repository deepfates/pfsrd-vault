Description: This threadbare hat allows its wearer to alter her appearance at will as with a disguise self spell, except she can only appear as a plainly dressed Small human child, adult halfling, or adult gnome, such as a peasant, blacksmith, or shopkeeper. The wearer can slightly alter the cap's appearance as part of the disguise, but otherwise must match the overall unremarkable look of the illusory form. Though invented and primarily used by Small humanoids, it can be used by any Small or [[Medium]] humanoid creature.
