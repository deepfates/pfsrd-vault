Name: [[Shad'gorum Nugget]]
Aura: faint abjuration
CL: 3
Slot: neck
Price: 4,200 gp
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This impossibly hard, lumpy piece of unforged iron originates from metal that remained cool after smelting-ore that resisted all attempts to forge it into another shape. Worshipers of [[Gorum]] believe this metal is a reflection of their god's unrelenting determination, and often fashion this "stubborn iron" into a pendant, though it is sometimes used as a mace head or as a counterweight to a greatsword or another large weapon instead. While wearing a Shad'[[Gorum]] nugget around the neck, the wearer gains fire resistance 1 and a +1 resistance bonus on Will saving throws. If [[Gorum]] is the wearer's patron, the wearer can use chill metal once per day. At will, the wearer can mend small metallic items as if using a mending spell.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], chill metal, mending, resist energy, resistance
