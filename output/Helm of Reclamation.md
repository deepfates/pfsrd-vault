Description: The helm of reclamation is designed to destroy large groups of undead or [[power]]ful individual undead creatures, and is often used by undead-hating [[cleric]]s with a flair for the dramatic. The gems of this helm produce sunburst (10 yellow diamonds), searing light (30 bloodstones), and daylight (40 opals).
