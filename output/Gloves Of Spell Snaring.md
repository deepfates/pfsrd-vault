Description: These thin gloves are covered in reflective glyphs and sigils, and the palms are slightly tacky. Like gloves of arrow snaring, twice per day the wearer can act as if she had the [[Snatch]] Arrow feat, even if she doesn't meet the prerequisites for that feat. In addition, the wearer can expend one of this item's uses per day to use the [[[[Snatch]] Arrows]] feat on a projectile targeting an ally in a space adjacent to her. As an immediate action, the wearer can expend one use of mythic [[power]] and one of this item's uses per day to block a spell targeting her or an adjacent ally, as the parry spell guardian path ability (see page 30).
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], [[Mythic Crafter]], shield, spell turning, creator must have the parry spell path ability
