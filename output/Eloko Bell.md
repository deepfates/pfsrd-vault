Description: This small, rusty iron bell contains great magic. When the bell is rung as a standard action, all creatures within 60 feet who can hear the bell must make a DC 14 Will save or be compelled to seek out the source of the sound for 7 rounds, moving at their normal speeds. If the sound leads its subjects into a dangerous area, each affected creature gets a second save. This is a mindaffecting compulsion effect. The bell affects a maximum of 24 HD of creatures. A bell can be used 5 times before it crumbles away into rusty flakes and becomes useless.
