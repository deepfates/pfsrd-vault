Name: [[Figurine of Wondrous Power (golden lions)]]
Aura: Moderate transmutation
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 16,500 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Each of the several kinds of figurines of wondrous [[power]] appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak. If a figurine of wondrous [[power]] is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its [[power]] departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time. Golden Lions: These figurines come in pairs. They become normal adult male lions. If slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from statuette form for 1 full week. Otherwise, they can be used once per day for up to 1 hour. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command word.
