Name: [[Gray Gambler's Hat]]
Aura: faint illusion and transmutation
CL: 1
Slot: head
Price: 2,400 gp
Weight: -
Description: This crumpled leather hat has roughly hammered metal studs around its brim, and is often worn by worshipers of Droskar who venerate the dwarf god for his cheating aspect. The wearer can use it as a hat of disguise, but only to disguise herself as a dwarf. Three times per day as a free action, the wearer can manipulate a rolled die within 10 feet (such as in a game of chance), altering hands slot; the wearer can not use another item (even another Inheritor's gauntlet) that also uses the hands slot, though a matching nonmagical gauntlet is often worn on the other hand. If [[Iomedae]] is the wearer's patron, the gauntlet lets the wearer use any sword he holds in that hand as a holy symbol. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word and give any sword he holds the [[power]]s of an evil outsider-bane weapon for 1 minute; this effect ends if the wearer drops the sword or removes the gauntlet. If the wearer uses a finger to draw [[Iomedae]]'s symbol on any solid surface, the symbol glows as brightly as a candle for 1 hour or until the wearer draws the symbol elsewhere (whichever comes first).
