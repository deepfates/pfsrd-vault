Name: Racing [[Broom Of [[Fly]]ing]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 30,000 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: A racing broom of flying functions like a broom of flying, except for 9 minutes per day it can fly faster than its standard counterpart. Activating this increased speed is a swift action. The broom's increased fly speed is 60 feet with a load up to 200 pounds, or at a speed of 40 feet carrying up to 400 pounds. Each minute at this faster speed uses 1 hour of the broom's daily flight time. As a swift action, the rider may expend 5 hours of flight time to increase the broom's speed to 120 feet with a load up to 200 pounds, or at a speed of 80 feet carrying up to 400 pounds. This speed boost lasts for 1 round, but when it ends there is a 50% chance that the broom gains the broken condition and is [[power]]less until repaired.
