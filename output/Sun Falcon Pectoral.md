Aura: faint evocation [light]
CL: 5
Slot: neck
Price: 5,400 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: This ornate pectoral necklace is crafted out of articulated gold plates arranged in the shape of a falcon-the sacred animal of Horus, the Ancient [[Osirion]] god of the sun and the sky. When outdoors and in an area with direct, natural sunlight, the wearer of a sun falcon pectoral can call down dazzling beams of sunlight from the sky once per day. As a standard action each round for 5 rounds, the wearer can call down a 5-foot-wide, 30-foot-long vertical sunbeam anywhere within 100 feet. A creature struck by a beam takes 3d6 points of damage and is blinded (a successful DC 14 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the blindness). The wearer does not need to call down a sunbeam each round, but once 5 rounds have passed, no more beams can be called down. Indoors, underground, or in areas of darkness, the wearer can instead create a daylight effect from the necklace once per day. The daylight effect lasts up to 2 hours. Whether used to create daylight or sunbeams, a sun falcon pectoral can only be used once per day.
