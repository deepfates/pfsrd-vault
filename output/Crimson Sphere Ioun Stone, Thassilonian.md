Description: Whether they were invented by the Azlanti or merely discovered by them, ioun stones were an important part of Azlanti society-and by extension, of Thassilonian society. Many of Thassilon's rulers- particularly runelords like Karzoug-took to the art of embedding these stones in their flesh. An ioun stone implanted in this manner cannot be sundered or stolen. Further rules on implanting ioun stones can be found in Pathfinder Campaign Setting: Seekers of Secrets. Thassilonian [[wizard]]s perfected and enhanced many forms of ioun stones, such as the four unusually [[power]]ful stones listed below. These stones are minor artifacts, and methods of their creation have been lost since Thassilon's fall. Crimson Sphere: This ioun stone grants a +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence (the bonuses from possessing multiple crimson spheres stack, up to a maximum of +6).
