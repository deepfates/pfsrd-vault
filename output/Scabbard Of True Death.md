Description: Whenever an assassin draws a weapon from the scab[[bard]] of true death and makes a successful death attack against her target, the DC of her true death ability increases by 4. In addition, regardless of whether the wielder has levels in the assassin class, the wielder gains the bleeding attack [[rogue]] talent as though she had a sneak attack that dealt 1d6 points of damage (thus, attacks that qualify as sneak attacks deal 1 point of bleed damage); if the wielder already has the bleeding attack [[rogue]] talent, the bleed damage caused by that talent is increased by 1.
