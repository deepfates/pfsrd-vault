benefit: Choose one branch of the Eagle Knights you hope to join. You gain a specific benefit based on this choice.

Each affected ally that obeys your orders gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls, Armor Class, and saving throws during that round. Steel Falcons: You deal +1 damage with weapon attacks directed at any creature against which you have concealment. If you have total concealment against the creature, this bonus increases to +2. Twilight Talons: During the surprise round, the threat range of your weapons doubles for any attack made against unaware targets. This does not stack with any other effect that expands the threat range of a weapon.
