Name: [[Sandstorm Dust]]
Aura: moderate evocation
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 9,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This ornate sack made of dyed leather contains a mixture of swirling atmospheric energies from the Plane of Air and gritty elemental dust from the Plane of Earth. As a standard action, the owner can blow a handful of sandstorm dust at a single creature of size Large or smaller within 10 feet. If the target fails at a DC 19 Reflex save, the sandstorm dust catches on the creature and grows to the size of a small sandstorm. At the beginning of the target's turn for the next 1d6+1 rounds, the creature is swept violently upward, thrown back to the ground, and then dropped in a random adjacent empty square, taking 1d6 points of damage from the impact. While the target lands on its feet each time, this does not prevent it from being dropped off a cliff or onto a dangerous patch of terrain. The affected creature can attempt to arrest itself as a move action with a successful DC 25 [[Acrobatic]]s check or DC 19 Reflex save; success means that the creature is not flung into the air that round. If the creature succeeds at two consecutive [[Acrobatic]]s checks or Reflex saves in this way, the sandstorm dissipates and the effect ends. A newly created bag of sandstorm dust contains enough dust for three uses.
