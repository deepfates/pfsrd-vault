name: [[Snatch]]
type: Monster
description: This creature can grab other creatures with ease.
prerequisites: Size Huge or larger.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: The creature can start a grapple when it hits with a claw or bite attack, as though it had the grab ability. If it grapples a creature three or more sizes smaller, it squeezes each round for automatic bite or claw damage with a successful grapple check. A snatched opponent held in the creature's mouth is not allowed a Reflex save against the creature's breath weapon, if it has one. The creature can drop a creature it has snatched as a free action or use a standard action to fling it aside. A f lung creature travels 1d6 X 10 feet, and takes 1d6 points of damage per 10 feet traveled. If the creature flings a snatched opponent while flying, the opponent takes this amount or falling damage, whichever is greater.
