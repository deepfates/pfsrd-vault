Name: [[Entwined Syrinx]]
Aura: moderate illusion
CL: 7
Slot: item
Price: 15,300 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This complex wind instrument is made of interwoven, gilded pipes. It is considered a masterwork musical instrument, granting a +2 bonus on all Perform (wind instrument) checks. The bonus is also added to the DC of any [[bard]]ic performances made using the entwined syrinx. Anytime anyone attempts to play the entwined syrinx, however, he must make a DC 15 Will save or be compelled to play a dirge of somber beauty. The dirge acts like the fascinate [[bard]]ic performance- even if the character is not a [[bard]] or cannot use Perform (wind instrument)-affecting every creature within 90 feet able to see and hear the character, including the musician playing the entwined syrinx. The DC to resist this effect is 12 + the character's Charisma modifier (though if it is being played by a [[bard]], the DC increases to include 1/2 the [[bard]]'s level; the +2 Perform bonus is included). This effect persists and the musician continues to play for 1 hour, or until the performance is interrupted.
