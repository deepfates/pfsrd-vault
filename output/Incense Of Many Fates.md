Name: [[Incense Of Many Fates]]
Aura: moderate divination
CL: 11
Slot: item
Price: 3,300 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: When used during meditation, this incense allows a samsaran's [[consciousness]] to pass through past or future lives to learn more about an important person, place, or thing. This functions like legend lore, but only works if the subject is at hand. The transcendental state lasts 1 hour, during which she can take no other actions. If she is disrupted during the meditation, the incense's effect is lost. Creatures other than samsarans can use this incense, but the connections to other lives are weaker and require a deeper meditation that takes 24 hours. Each block of incense lasts for 1 use.
