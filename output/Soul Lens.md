Description: This large lens of green crystal has the Thassilonian rune for transmutation and greed inscribed upon its surface. The lens is fitted in an iron ring, which is attached to an articulated arm that allows the lens's position to be adjusted to any angle and configuration. The soul lens has but a single purpose-whenever a creature is subjected to a specific ritual in which its body is branded, tattooed, or otherwise marked with the [[Sihedron]] rune, the lens can [[focus]] upon that creature's soul At any point thereafter when the marked creature dies, its soul passes through this lens on its way into the afterlife and eventual judgement before [[Pharasma]]-as the soul passes through, the soul lens filters elements of the sin of greed from the soul and [[focus]]es that fragment of soul-energy into the runewell of greed. This does not significantly damage the soul (although it does cause it a severe amount of spiritual anguish)-a creature that dies and has its soul filtered through the soul lens can still be brought back to life as normal.
