Name: [[Hamatula Hide]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 9
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 44,215 gp
Weight: 12 lbs.
Description: Crafted from the flayed skin of a barbed devil, this imposing +2 spiked hide [[armor]] weighs half the normal weight. When its wearer rages, the [[armor]]'s spikes elongate and the hide bonds to her skin, providing fire resistance 10. Any creature that strikes the wearer with a melee weapon, unarmed strike, or a natural weapon while the spikes are elongated takes 1d8+6 points of piercing damage from the [[armor]]'s barbs (unless using a weapon with reach). While the wearer is enraged, spells that cause additional damage to evil outsiders deal that increased damage to her. A [[barbarian]] with fiend totem rage [[power]]s gains additional benefits from hamatula hide. If she has the lesser fiend totem rage [[power]], she gains a +1 profane bonus to Armor Class while raging. If she has the fiend totem rage [[power]], the damage caused by her barbs increases to 2d8+6 and stacks with the barbed defense granted by the [[armor]]. If she has the greater fiend totem ability, she gains fire resistance 20 when raging.
