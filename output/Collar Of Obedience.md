Name: [[Collar Of Obedience]]
Aura: moderate enchantment
CL: 9
Slot: neck
Price: 5,000 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: This collar of bright red leather bears a small golden pendant and makes the wearer much more biddable and compliant. The wearer takes a -4 penalty on saving throws against mind-affecting effects used by the creature that placed the collar on it, and that creature gains a +4 bonus on Handle [[Animal]] checks to train or push the wearer. Any other creatures take a -4 penalty on Handle [[Animal]] checks against the wearer, and the wearer gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against their mind-affecting effects. A collar of obedience can be placed on any Small, [[Medium]], or Large creature. Placing a collar of obedience on a creature is a full-round action that requires a successful grapple maneuver. Removing the collar is also a full-round action, and the creature removing it must have precise digits capable of working the locking mechanism. A creature made helpful with wild empathy does not resist having the collar equipped or removed.
