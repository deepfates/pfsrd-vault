Description: This implant appears as a demonic eye, tongue, finger, ear, or nose floating in a small jar of transparent fluid. In order to gain the benefit of this implant, the contents of the jar-thick fluid, body part, and all-must be consumed as a full-round action. This immediately grants a permanent +8 racial bonus on all Perception checks (note that as a racial bonus, this does not stack with any other racial bonuses a creature might already possess). After gaining this bonus, the part of the creature's body corresponding to the body part eaten changes to match the eaten part-eyes might become red, ears might grow long and pointed, a tongue might become forked, and so on.
