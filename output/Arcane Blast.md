name: [[Arcane Blast]]
type: Mythic
description: You can manipulate raw eldritch energies to do more than just deal damage.
prerequisites: [[Arcane Blast]]APG.
prerequisite_feats: [[Arcane Blast]]
benefit: When you use [[Arcane Blast]], you may halve the damage dice to also perform your choice of either a trip or bull rush combat maneuver against the target of the blast. You can't move with an opponent you bull rush with this feat. You gain a bonus on your combat maneuver check for this attempt equal to half the spell level of the spell you sacrificed when using [[Arcane Blast]], and you can substitute your Intelligence or Charisma modifier in place of your Strength modifier when determining your combat maneuver bonus. In addition, you can expend one use of mythic [[power]] to change the damage dice of your [[Arcane Blast]] to d8s instead of d6s.
