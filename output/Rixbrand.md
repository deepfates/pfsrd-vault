Description: This fabled greatsword, most recently carried by the hero Arnlaugr the [[Fear]]less, was lost in the Black Tarn decades ago-it likely remains in some creature's den or is perhaps wielded by one of the tarn's denizens to this day. Since that loss, several duplicates of the legendary sword have been created- these are wielded today by mercenaries and adventurers alike, although they tend to end up in dragon hoards in the end when a would-be dragonslayer tackles something beyond her capacity to endure even with the blade in hand. 's double-sided blade is folded blue steel, intricately engraved with ancient runes that light up with electric flame in the presence of dragonkind. The hilt is inlaid with ebony and wrapped with silver wire; the pommel features two silvered dragon heads. This weapon is a +3 wounding dragon bane greatsword. When the blade scores a critical hit on a dragon, the dragon heads on its pommel spit boiling acid into the wound hewn by the blade. This deals an additional 1d10 points of acid damage and 1d10 points of fire damage to the dragon. 's wielder gains a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws against breath weapons, spell-like abilities, and spells from dragons.
