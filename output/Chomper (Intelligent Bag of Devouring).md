Name: [[Chomper]] (Intelligent [[Bag of Devouring]])
Aura: strong conjuration
CL: 17
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 15 lbs.
Description: Most bags of devouring appear as normal sacks, but [[Chomper]] is unlike most bags of devouring. Sporting rows of vicious teeth, a bad attitude, and a thirst to devour all things, this intelligent cursed item believes it is the favored maw and most important appendage of a creature it refers to as the Eater of All. [[Chomper]] hates all creatures except for demons, whom it considers kindred [[spirits]] of destruction. [[Chomper]] has all of the magical abilities of a regular bag of devouring (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 539), along with the following additional [[power]]s. Bite: As a standard action, [[Chomper]]'s possessor can swing the bag by its straps in an attempt to strike any target within a 5-foot radius. The possessor targets a single creature or unattended item with this attack. [[Chomper]] (not the wielder) makes a single bite attack against the creature or item targeted: bite +14 (1d10+5 and bleed 2). This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity, despite the quasit's Tiny size. Attacks made in this way are never modified by the wielder's abilities-Azrikalis cannot modify his attack roll with his Dexterity modifier, for example, nor can he use [[Chomper]] to make sneak attacks. Hateful Curse: When a non-demon is in possession of [[Chomper]], the bag's cursed aura imparts a -1 penalty on all of its wielder's attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If [[Chomper]] manages to seize control of a non-demon host through personality conflict, it directs its host to seek out victims to feed to it.
