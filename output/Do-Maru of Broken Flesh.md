CL: 9
Slot: [[armor]]
Price: 20,550 gp
Weight: 30 lbs.
Description: Once per day as a standard action, the wearer of this +2 do-maru [[armor]] (Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Combat 128) can activate the [[armor]] to heal 4d8+9 points of damage and end any and all of the following conditions affecting the wearer: ability damage, blinded, confused, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, nauseated, poisoned, and sickened. In addition, this effect functions as break enchantment upon a single additional effect of the wearer's choice that is affecting the wearer and that can be legally affected by this effect. Such healing, however, comes at a cost. The do-maru of broken flesh creates vivid, ugly scars on the wearer, who takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage each time this ability is used. Do-maru is medium [[armor]] that provides a +5 [[armor]] bonus. The [[armor]] has an arcane spell failure chance of 25%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +4, and an [[armor]] check penalty of -4. Do-maru costs 200 gp and weighs 30 lbs.
