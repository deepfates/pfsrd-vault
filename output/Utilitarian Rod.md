Name: [[Utilitarian Rod]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 8
Slot: item
Price: 5,000 gp
Weight: 5 lb.
Description: Created by the Arcanamirium, this plain wooden rod is capped with steel, with 10 buttons along its length; it looks rugged and is usually scratched and stained. Pushing any of the buttons is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon. Unless otherwise stated, pressing a button a second time reverts the rod to its basic form. The following functions have no limit on the number of times they can be employed. Brace/jack: The end caps flatten into 2-foot-diameter discs and the wooden haft extends up to 10 feet, creating a brace for a tunnel ceiling or lifting a heavy object 10 feet into the air. Bridge: The rod flattens and extends to 1 foot wide, 1 inch thick, and 12 feet long. This form can support 4,000 pounds. Climbing pole/ladder. A spike that can anchor in stone extrudes from one end, while the other sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. Crowbar: This functions like a normal crowbar. Drill: One metal cap extends to a drill-like point and begins to spin, easily drilling a 3-inch-diameter hole through 3 feet of wood or 1 foot of stone per minute. Mallet: Though not intended as a weapon, a character can attack with the rod in this form as if it were a [[Medium]] warhammer with a -2 penalty. Portable ram: This functions like a normal portable ram, except up to three people are needed to help the wielder. Saw: This works like a normal two-person saw. Shovel: Pressing this button makes the rod cycle between a short-handled shovel, a long-handled shovel, and its basic form. Wedge: One metal cap extends to form a flat chisel shape, such as for cutting wood or breaking stone (normally a hammer or mallet is used with it for this task).
