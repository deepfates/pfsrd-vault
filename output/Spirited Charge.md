name: [[Spirited Charge]]
type: Mythic
description: Your mounted charge knocks the wind and wits from those foolish enough to stand against you.
prerequisites: [[Spirited Charge]].
prerequisite_feats: [[Spirited Charge]]
benefit: When you hit an opponent with a mounted charge, that opponent must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Str modifier) or be staggered for a number of rounds equal to your tier. If you use a lance with this attack, increase the saving throw DC by 2. As a free action before you make the attack, you can expend one use of mythic [[power]] to daze your opponent on a failed saving throw instead of staggering it.
