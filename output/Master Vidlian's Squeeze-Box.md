Name: [[Master Vidlian's Squeeze-Box]]
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 6,000 gp
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This concertina was created by the notorious Chelish [[bard]] Vidlian the Reveler. It can be used like a masterwork concertina, providing a +2 bonus on Perform (keyboard instruments) checks. At any one time, Master Vidlian's squeeze-box is either more compressed than extended or more extended than compressed, and s[[witch]]ing between the two is a free action (and in fact, happens regularly when the instrument is played). When the concertina is compressed and held in a hand, the wielder gains the compression ability. When the concertina is extended and held in a hand, the wielder is immune to constriction damage (as from constrict attacks) and damage from being buried, although the wielder gains no protection from suffocation.
