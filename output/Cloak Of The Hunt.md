Name: [[Cloak Of The Hunt]]
Aura: strong illusion
CL: 12
Slot: shoulders
Price: 12,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This rough-spun green cloak is trimmed in wolf fur and fastened with a silver clasp. With the cloak drawn over his shoulders and the hood pulled up, the wearer becomes one with his surroundings, gaining a +5 bonus on Stealth checks and on Survival skill checks made to follow tracks. The cloak also renders the wearer immune to the scent ability. If the wearer expends one use of mythic [[power]], the cloak turns him invisible for 1 hour, as greater invisibility. If the wearer makes an attack, the effects last for 1 minute after the attack, then end. A character made invisible by this cloak can't be detected with detect magic or other spells or effects that detect magical auras. The greater invisibility can't be penetrated, revealed, or dispelled by spells of 2nd level or lower (such as see invisibility or glitterdust), though true seeing and dust of appearance can reveal the wearer's presence.
