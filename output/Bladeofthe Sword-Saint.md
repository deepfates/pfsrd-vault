Name: [[Bladeofthe Sword-Saint]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 8
Slot: item
Price: 75,350 gp
Weight: 6 lbs.
Description: This exquisitely forged katana is the result of painstaking attention and craftsmanship by one who is dedicated to mastering swordplay in its highest form. A blade of the sword-[[sai]]nt is a +3 ki intensifying katana. In the hands of a [[monk]], it becomes an instrument of deadly utility. In addition to its more common properties, this weapon can be employed as though the wielder were unarmed: the wielder benefits from feats such as [[Deflect Arrows]] or [[[[Snatch]] Arrows]] (although he can redirect attacks but not catch them if he has no hands free), and a [[monk]] treats the blade as a [[monk]] weapon for use in his flurry of blows.
