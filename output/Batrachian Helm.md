Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: This oily bronze helm is fashioned in the shape of a frog's head. Three times per day as a swift action, the helm fires an unerring tongue of force at a visible target within 20 feet. If the target is an unattended object weighing 250 pounds or less, it is pulled 20 feet toward the wearer. If the target is a creature of the wearer's size or smaller, the wearer may make a combat maneuver check as a free action to pull the target 20 feet toward him. If the target is a creature larger than the wearer, an unattended object weighing more than 250 pounds, or an immobile structure such as a wall, the wearer is pulled 20 feet toward the target. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the object or creature stops if the movement would move it into a solid object or creature.
