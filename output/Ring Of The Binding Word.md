Description: This black iron ring always bears an engraving in Infernal that serves as reminder to the wearer of a pact made with a devil. The ring may only be crafted in the presence of a devil while a mortal enters into a contract with it. During forging, the ring creates a telepathic bond between the devil and mortal as per the spell. Additionally, once per day, the wearer or the devil may activate the ring to utilize greater teleport with the restriction that the wearer teleport only to the devil's side. If the terms of the contract are met or either the mortal or devil are killed, the ring reverts to a mundane piece of jewelry. The mortal may not remove a ring of the binding word while it remains enchanted.
