Description: [[Eroeme]] is a lawful-aligned intelligent +2 mithral monstrous humanoid bane greatsword that can resize to fit the hands of its wielder. In the days when Azlant battled the serpentfolk empire, five lesser replicas of Savith's legendary magical sword were crafted for her closest allies. One of these weapons was [[Eroeme]], made for the cyclops general Aveshai with the specific purpose of slaying the serpentfolk and their agents wherever they might be found on or beneath Golarion. The sword's knowledge and experience was invaluable to General Aveshai as he faced the serpentfolk in Ilmurea, and its disappearance (along with the general) somewhere beneath the Mwangi jungles was a blow to Azlanti morale.
