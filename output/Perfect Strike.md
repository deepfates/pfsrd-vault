name: [[Perfect Strike]]
type: Combat
description: When wielding a [[monk]] weapon, your attacks can be extremely precise.
prerequisites: Dex 13, Wis 13, [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], base attack bonus +8.
prerequisite_feats: [[Improved Unarmed Strike]]
benefit: You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). You must use one of the following weapons to make the attack: kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, [[sai]], and siangham. You can roll your attack roll twice and take the higher result. If one of these rolls is a critical threat, the other roll is used as your confirmation roll (your choice if they are both critical threats). You may attempt a perfect attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.
normal: 0
special: A weapon master [[monk]] or zen archer [[monk]] receives [[Perfect Strike]] as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A [[monk]] may attempt an perfect strike attack a number of times per day equal to his [[monk]] level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than [[monk]].
