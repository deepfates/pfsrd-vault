Name: [[Enmity Fetish]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 40,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This small talisman is comprised of teeth, fingers, ears, or other grotesque trophies taken from the freshly dead. Each talisman is imbued with an intense animosity toward a particular type of creature, chosen from the [[ranger]] favored enemy list when the fetish is created. Once per day, the talisman can impart this animosity to a [[ranger]] (or other character with the favored enemy class feature), replacing one of his favored enemies with the fetish's designated creature type. This lasts 24 hours. To activate the fetish, the [[ranger]] must spend 10 minutes quietly holding it; he then may select one of his favored enemies to replace with the item's favored enemy. For example, a [[ranger]] with a +6 favored enemy bonus against orcs may use a dragon-hating fetish, gaining a +6 favored enemy bonus against dragons and losing the bonus against orcs for 24 hours. Alternatively, once per day, the bearer can activate the fetish as a swift action, but its effects only last 10 minutes and the bearer only gains half his favored enemy bonus (for example, the [[ranger]] would lose his orc bonus and only gain a +3 favored enemy bonus against dragons for 10 minutes).
