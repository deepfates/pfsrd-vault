Description: The rune of Baphomet emblazons this slim, leather-bound volume. Taken from a larger work, the [[Fasciculus Labyrinthum]] details many of the rituals of Baphomet worship. Included in its pages are details of how to operate the imago lens and incomplete instructions to constructing one. As long as the book is carried (even if carried in an extradimensional space like a bag of holding), it grants its carrier immunity to maze spells and a +4 profane bonus on all saving throws against insanity and confusion effects.
