Name: [[Verdant Boots]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: feet
Price: 12,000 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: The wearer of these boots can, on command three times per day, cause her current square to sprout a thick canopy of fruit-bearing or otherwise edible plants. These plants count as difficult terrain and grant cover to any [[Medium]] or smaller creature within the square. They also provide enough food to sustain two [[Medium]] creatures for 1 full day. While the plants can grow on surfaces that would not normally support vegetation such as a wooden floor or cave stone, they cannot sprout on surfaces explicitly hostile to vegetation. The plants are usually of a sort common to the terrain or climate of the area in which they were produced. They disappear after 24 hours or when completely harvested, whichever comes first.
