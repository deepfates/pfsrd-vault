Description: This magical stone is carved into the likeness of a featureless humanoid curled into a fetal position. Its widened eyes stare hauntingly and glow with eerie paleness when activated. The stone serves as a receptacle for a single soul. A living creature may set a condition or set of conditions that draw its soul into the eraminho stone; if the creature is alive when this occurs, its body and all its equipment are drawn into the stone as well. While within the ioun stone, the soul may communicate telepathically with any creature using the ioun stone. In addition to the conditions needed to draw the soul into the stone, conditions may be set to release it, either with its body (if alive) or to the Boneyard (if dead).
