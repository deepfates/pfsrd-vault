Name: [[Father's Forgehammer]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 3
Slot: item
Price: 4,800 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This iron blacksmith's hammer bears designs of [[Torag]]'s holy symbol; it is not designed for combat, but the bearer can use it as a [[Medium]] light hammer. Once per day, the bearer can strike the hammer hard against a weapon to target that weapon with magic weapon. The owner gains a +2 competence bonus on all smithing ([[armor]]smithing, blacksmithing, weaponsmithing, and so on) skill checks made when crafting with the forgehammer. If [[Torag]] is the owner's patron, once per day the owner can strike the hammer against another character's [[armor]] or shield to cast shield other on that character. If the owner can craft magic weapons or [[armor]] and uses the forgehammer during the crafting, the total time to craft the item is decreased by 25% (minimum 1 day). This does not reduce the cost to create the item. A particular forgehammer can aid in only one item's crafting at a time.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], magic weapon, shield other, creator must have 5 ranks in Craft ([[armor]]) or Craft (weapons)
Cost: 2,400 gp
