Aura: moderate divination
CL: 10
Slot: item
Price: 70,000 gp
Weight: 7 lbs.
Description: This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. So well-known are these items that many so-called [[oracle]]s or fortune-tellers use similar appearing (but completely non-magical) replicas of these items to ply their trades. A character can use a magical crystal ball to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell scrying (Will DC 16 negates). A crystal ball can be used multiple times per day, but the DC to resist its [[power]] decreases by 1 for each additional use. Certain crystal balls have additional [[power]]s that can be used through the crystal ball on the target viewed. CRYSTAL BALL TYPE Price Crystal ball 42,000 gp Crystal ball with see invisibility 50,000 gp Crystal ball with detect thoughts 51,000 gp (Will DC 13 negates) Crystal ball with telepathy* 70,000 gp Crystal ball with true seeing 80,000 gp * The viewer is able to send and receive silent mental messages with the person appearing in the crystal ball. Once per day, the character may attempt to implant a suggestion (as the spell, Will DC 14 negates) as well.
