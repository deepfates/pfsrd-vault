Name: [[Shadowwraith Heart]]
Aura: strong necromancy
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: This strangely shaped, ebon-colored rock streaked with deep purple veins is actually the petrified heart of a long-forgotten mythic hero. Over the centuries, the heart has appeared as an amulet, the head of a staff, and a mace head. Regardless of its form, the [[Shadowwraith Heart]] functions the same. The heart seeks out the location of the nearest source of mythic [[power]]- either a creature or place-and when brought to the source devours its [[power]]. As soon as it comes within a 60-foot-radius of a mythic creature, it begins to leech off that creature's mythic [[power]]. Each round a mythic creature remains within the area of effect, it must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or lose 1d4 uses of mythic [[power]]. If the heart drains a mythic creature of all its daily uses of mythic [[power]], the creature loses a mythic tier. The tier loss is semi-permanent, remaining until the creature successfully completes one trial.
