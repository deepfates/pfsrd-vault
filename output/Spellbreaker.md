name: [[Spellbreaker]]
type: Mythic
description: You're a spellcaster's worst nightmare.
prerequisites: [[Spellbreaker]].
prerequisite_feats: [[Spellbreaker]]
benefit: Any non-mythic creature you threaten provokes an attack of opportunity from you whenever it uses a spell or spell-like ability, even when casting defensively or casting a quickened spell. If a non-mythic creature within 30 feet of you uses a spell or spell-like ability, you can expend one use of mythic [[power]] to make a ranged attack against that creature as an attack of opportunity (even if the creature wouldn't normally provoke attacks of opportunity). You must have a ranged weapon in hand or have a free hand and the non-mythic [[Quick Draw]] feat to use this ability. You can use this ability against a mythic creature by expending two uses of mythic [[power]].
