name: [[Stalwart]]
type: General
description: You adopt a defensive stance that allows you to absorb and redirect hits.
prerequisites: [[Diehard]], [[Endurance]], base attack bonus +4.
prerequisite_feats: [[Diehard]], [[Endurance]]
benefit: While using the total defense action, fighting defensively action, or Combat [[Expert]]ise, you can forgo the dodge bonus to AC you would normally gain to instead gain an equivalent amount of DR, to a maximum of DR 5/-, until the start of your next turn. This damage reduction stacks with DR you gain from class features, such as the [[barbarian]]'s, but not with DR from any other source. If you are denied your Dexterity bonus to AC, you are also denied this DR.
