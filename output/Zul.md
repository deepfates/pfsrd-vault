Price: 18,395 gp
Weight: 4 lbs.
Description: [[Zul]] is a +1 human bane trident that has been passed down from chieftain to chieftain in Krelloort's tribe for generations. [[Zul]]'s three-pronged head is crafted of magically strengthened seashells, and its haft is composed of rough, twisted coral that deals 1 point of damage each time it is grasped, unless the wielder has a natural [[armor]] bonus or is wearing gauntlets. As an immediate action after a successful melee attack with the trident, [[Zul]]'s wielder can transmute the substance of the target creature into rigid coral. This attack deals 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and slows the target (as the spell) for 1 round as its flesh calcifies. A DC 16 Fortitude save negates the slow effect but not the ability damage. A target reduced to 0 Dexterity is permanently petrified, transformed into inert, mindless coral. Break enchantment or restoration reverses all of the effects of this calcification. This ability can be used up to 7 times per day.
Requirements: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], calcific touch (Advanced Players Guide 208), summon monster I
