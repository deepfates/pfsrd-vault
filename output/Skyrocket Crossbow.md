Name: [[Skyrocket Crossbow]]

CL: 6
Slot: item
Price: 10,400 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: The stock and bow of this +1 distance hand crossbow are decorated with the golden head of an osprey, sea eagle, or other avian creature. Three times per day, a skyrocket crossbow can imbue one of two special abilities on its ammunition. The first causes a bolt fired from the crossbow to explode in a dazzling burst of colored light when it hits a creature or object, or if it reaches its maximum range increment (600 feet). Creatures within a 10-foot radius of the target point are blinded for 1d4+1 rounds. A successful DC 13 Will save means a creature is dazzled for 1 minute instead. Sightless creatures, or those without line of sight to the target point, are unaffected. The second ability causes a bolt fired from the crossbow to function as a screaming bolt (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 475).
Requirements: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], clairaudience/ clairvoyance, doom, flare burst (Advanced Player's Guide 223)
