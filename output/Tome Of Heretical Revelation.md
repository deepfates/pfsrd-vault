Aura: strong abjuration
CL: 17
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 5 lbs.
Description: This thick book appears to be an educational treatise filled with philosophical insights. Anyone who reads from this cursed book and has a patron deity must make a DC 20 Will save or be overcome by a crushing sense of doubt and hopelessness as she loses all faith in her deity's teachings. Anyone who fails this save loses all divine spellcasting ability, as well as class abilities from classes that grant divine spells, and she can't gain additional levels in those classes. She can regain her abilities and advancement potential if she atones (see the atonement spell description). Succeeding at the Will save still leaves the reader shaken for 10 minutes.
