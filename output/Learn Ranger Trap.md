type: General
description: You learn how to create one kind of [[ranger]] trap.
prerequisites: Survival 5 ranks.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: Select one [[ranger]] trap (see page 20). You may use this trap a number of times per day equal to your Wisdom bonus (minimum 1). The DC for your trap is equal to 10 + 1/2 your character's level + your Wisdom bonus, and it lasts 1 day per 2 character levels. If you aren't a [[ranger]], you can only set extraordinary traps with this feat; like all extraordinary [[ranger]] traps, this decreases the trap's DC by 2.
