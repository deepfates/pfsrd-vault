Name: [[[[Monk]]ey Belt]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 8
Slot: belt
Price: 9,400 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This furry brown belt resembles the tail of a [[monk]]ey. The belt grants the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the belt is worn. The wearer does not lose his Dexterity bonus to AC while climbing, and does not take a -5 penalty on Climb checks when climbing at half his speed. As a swift action the wearer can command the belt to animate, transforming it into a prehensile tail under the wearer's control. The tail does not grant the wearer any additional attacks or actions per round, nor can it wield weapons, but it can make unarmed attacks and hold or manipulate objects about as well as the wearer's normal limbs (though any activity requiring fingers is beyond the tail's capabilities). The belt can function as a tail for 5 minutes per day. These minutes do not need to be consecutive.
