Description: A vurra is a carving of a giant's head, usually a god but sometimes a hero, loved one, or historical figure. This hand-sized gray stone is carved to resemble a bearded, wise-looking man with a squarish skull. It has a leather strap threaded through a hole in the top, and is strangely heavy for its size. The wearer gains a +2 bonus on Craft (sculpting) checks. Once per day, the wearer can use magic stone, and this ability can affect even the small boulders favored by giants. The carved face grows stern and angry when worn by a creature with a chaotic alignment, only returning to its normal expression when removed or in the hands of a nonchaotic creature. If the giant god Minderhal is the wearer's patron, once per day the wearer may use owl's wisdom.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], magic stone, owl's wisdom, creator must have 5 ranks in Craft (sculpting)
