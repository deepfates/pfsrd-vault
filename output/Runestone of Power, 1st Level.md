Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 17
Slot: item
Price: 2,000 gp
Weight: -
Description: A runestone of [[power]] is a small chip of polished stone etched with a rune. Traditionally, this rune is one of many Thassilonian runes for magic, but more recently created runestones of [[power]] often substitute runes from other cultures-the nature of the rune itself has no effect on the runestone's actual [[power]]s. These objects are potent aids to all spellcasters who cast spells spontaneously ([[bard]]s, [[inquisitor]]s, [[oracle]]s, [[sorcerer]]s, and [[summoner]]s, but not to spellcasters like [[cleric]]s who have the option to spontaneously cast certain spells). Once per day, a spontaneous caster can draw upon a runestone of [[power]] to cast a spell-doing so is part of the spellcasting action, and expends that runestone's [[power]] for the day rather than one of the spellcaster's actual spell slots for the day. An expended runestone of [[power]] recharges its capacity after 24 hours. The spell must be of a particular level, depending on the runestone.
