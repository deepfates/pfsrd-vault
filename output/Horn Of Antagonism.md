Name: [[Horn Of Antagonism]]
Aura: faint enchantment
CL: 3
Slot: item
Price: 20,000 gp
Weight: 4 lbs.
Description: Carved from the bone of some giant beast, this large horn emits an eerie, heart-lurching moan when sounded. A creature with the favored enemy class feature may blow the horn as a standard action to daze one type of favored enemy within 90 feet for 1d4 rounds (DC 13 Will save negates). Creatures suffer a penalty on this save equal to the [[ranger]]'s favored enemy bonus against that type of creature. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect; creatures that cannot hear the horn are immune to its magic. The horn's magic works once per day.
