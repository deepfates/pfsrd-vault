Name: [[Sword Of The Mists]]
Aura: strong conjuration and transmutation
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 12 lbs.
Description: Forged by [[power]]ful fey from the primal word as a gift to mortal champions, a sword of mists is a +6 defending greatsword of gleaming blue steel with a stag's head pommel. Strange, ancient runic etchings encircle the rain guard, and the cross guard is fashioned in the shape of thorny vines. Anyone who wields the weapon gains low-light vision, resist nature's lure (as the [[druid]] class feature), and the ability to speak and understand Sylvan. The wielder can expend one use of mythic [[power]] to imbue the blade for 1 minute with the ability to bypass the hardness of any solid object and cut through even the toughest material as if slicing through butter. Once per week, the wielder can expend one use of mythic [[power]] to enter the primal [[world]] of fey from the Material Plane or vice versa.
