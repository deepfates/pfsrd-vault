Description: Wearing these form-fitting fingerless black gloves makes the wearer's arms and body more flexible. As a swift action, the wearer can lengthen his arms for up to 10 rounds per day, gaining an additional 5 feet of reach. These rounds need not be consecutive. Attacking with these extended arms is unwieldy, and the wearer takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, increasing to -4 if he is using two-handed weapons. Even when his limbs aren't extended, the wearer gains a +5 enhancement bonus on Escape Artist checks and [[Acrobatic]]s checks to avoid falling damage. The wearer is still able to use hand-based natural attacks such as claws while wearing the gloves.
