Name: Figurine Of Wondrous Power, Basalt [[Dragon]]
Aura: strong transmutation
CL: 20
Slot: item
Price: 60,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This fist-sized, carved dragon is sculpted from volcanic rock. It becomes either a pseudodragon or a flame drake (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 2 106), depending on the command word used. The transformation can take place twice per day, with a maximum duration of 2 continuous hours. The pseudodragon can use its telepathy to communicate with its owner over any distance, but not across planes. By expending one use of mythic [[power]], the user of the figurine can instead transform the figurine into a young red dragon. If the user is at least 5th tier, she can instead expend two uses of mythic [[power]] to transform the figurine into an adult red dragon. If the user is at least 9th tier, she can instead expend four uses of mythic [[power]] to transform the figurine into an ancient red dragon. Transforming the figurine into a true dragon renders the figurine [[power]]less for 1 week after the transformation ends.
Requirements: [[Craft Wondrous Item]], [[Mythic Crafter]], animate objects, form of the dragon III, telepathic bond
