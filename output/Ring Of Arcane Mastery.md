Description: This ring is a thin but sturdy piece of forged steel crafted to resemble a serpent swallowing its tail, and is magically imbued to reveal the secrets of arcane mastery to its wearer. The ring allows a wearer with an arcane pool to store up to 4 points from his arcane pool in the ring as a swift action. These points remain in the ring until used. A wearer can spend arcane pool points stored in the ring as if they were his own, or can spend them in each of the following ways. • As a free action, the wearer can expend 1 arcane pool point stored in the ring to gain a +2 bonus on Concentration checks for 1 round. • As a standard action, the wearer can expend 1 arcane pool point stored in the ring to use the pool strike [[magus]] arcana (Ultimate Magic 12) using his own [[magus]] level to determine the effect. As an immediate action, the wearer can expend up to 4 arcane pool points stored in the ring to use the reflection [[magus]] arcana (Ultimate Magic 12).
