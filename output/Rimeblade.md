Name: [[Rimeblade]]
Aura: moderate evocation [cold]
CL: 8
Slot: item
Price: 16,955 gp
Weight: 4 lbs.
Description: This +1 frost scimitar has been forged from a single piece of razor-sharp, super-hardened ice. A rimeblade automatically resizes itself to match the size of its wielder, and if a rimeblade is damaged, the wielder can cause the blade to melt away and reform with full hit points as a full-round action. This ability cannot be used if the weapon is destroyed. Once per day on command, the wielder can transform a rimeblade into a beam of ice-cold flame called rimefire. The weapon is still wielded as scimitar, and attacks with the blade-like beam are melee touch attacks that deal 1d8+3 points of cold damage (regardless of the wielder's size). Because the beam is immaterial, the wielder's Strength modifier doesn't apply to damage. In addition, a creature that takes cold damage from the rimefire beam is covered in clinging frost and is entangled for 1 round. The rimefire beam lasts for 1 minute, after which the weapon returns to its normal form. In addition, once per day as a swift action before an attack, a rimeblade's wielder can cause the blade to glow with a pale blue radiance. On a successful attack, the rimeblade deals an additional 4d6 points of cold damage and causes the target to be staggered for 1 round. If the attack is a critical hit, the target is staggered for 1 minute instead. This effect ends after a single attack, regardless of whether the attack is successful or not.
