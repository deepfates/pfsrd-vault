Name: [[Guard Of Man]]
Aura: strong abjuration
CL: 15
Slot: shield
Price: 17,180 gp
Weight: 45 lbs.
Description: This massive, imposing +2 spell resistance (13) tower shield is a metal bulwark engraved with the main edicts of the Laws of Man. The spell resistance special ability of this shield works only against divine spells and does not ward the bearer against arcane magic. While held, the shield grants a +4 resistance bonus on Fortitude saving throws against divine spells and spell-like abilities. Three times per day as a swift action, when the wielder of a guard of man is in the area of channeled energy (regardless of whether she is excluded by an effect such as [[Selective Channeling]]), she can rebuke the god [[power]]ing the ability. Using this ability causes the text on the guard of man to glow and decreases the amount of channeled energy by half (minimum 1). This reduction affects the channeled energy itself, and thus reduces the effect on all targets within its area. The [[power]] of the channeled energy can be further reduced with a successful Will saving throw, as normal.
