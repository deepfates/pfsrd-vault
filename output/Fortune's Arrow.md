Name: [[Fortune's Arrow]]
Aura: strong evocation
CL: 15
Slot: item
Price: 0
Weight: 1/10 lb.
Description: While this +3 seeking arrow is carried, it grants its bearer a +2 luck bonus on saving throws and skill checks. The wielder doubles her favored enemy bonus on attack and damage rolls against any creature of that type she attacks with the arrow. When taking a full-round action to fire a single shot using the arrow, the wielder ignores all range penalties for that attack. By expending one use of mythic [[power]] while such an attack, the wielder scores an automatic critical hit if the attack hits, and the arrow bypasses any damage reduction the target possesses. Fortune's arrow can always be recovered if searched for. Even if lost, it finds its way back to its previous owner within 1d6 days as long as she still lives. Fortune's arrow fails to return to its owner only if she dies or freely gives it to another.
