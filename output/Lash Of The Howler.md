Name: [[Lash Of The Howler]]
Aura: moderate necromancy
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 18,305 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: The lash of the howler is a +1 vicious scorpion whip tipped with quills torn from a howler's mane. Each time a creature takes damage from the lash of the howler, it must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save or a quill breaks off and lodges in its flesh. The whip instantly sprouts a new quill to replace the one lost. The quill leaves the target sickened until it is removed. Removing a single quill from a creature requires a DC 15 [[Heal]] check made as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the check is exceeded, one additional quill can be removed. On a failed check, a quill is still removed but the process deals 1d4+1 points of damage to the victim.
