Description: [[Shadowblood]] is among the most notorious of drugs-a fluid infused with a shadow demon's essence. Anyone who drinks this substance must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of cold damage and 1d4 points of Wisdom damage, and become nauseated for 1d6 rounds. Thereafter, the target gains 1d10+5 temporary hit points, cold resistance 5, and darkvision 60 feet. These effects persist for 1 hour, during which demons take a -4 penalty on saving throws against the drinker's spells and spell-like abilities of the shadow subschool. [[Shadowblood]] is exceedingly addictive and carries some significant disadvantages. Each time a creature takes a dose of shadowblood, it must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or become addicted-shadowblood addiction is a severe addiction (see page 236 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide). A creature under the influence of shadowblood or suffering from shadowblood addiction takes a -4 penalty on all saving throws against possession type effects made by demons, and can never gain the benefits of protection from evil or similar spells against such effects.
