name: [[Defending Eidolon]]
type: General
description: You have trained your [[eidolon]] to protect you.
prerequisites: [[Shield]] ally feature.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: Whenever you are adjacent to your [[eidolon]], you can choose for the [[eidolon]] to take a -1 penalty on melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +1 dodge bonus to your Armor Class. When your [[eidolon]]'s base attack bonus reaches +5, and for every +5 thereafter, the penalty increases by -1 and the dodge bonus increases by +1. You must choose to use this feat when your [[eidolon]] is making an attack or full-attack action with melee or natural weapons, and its effect lasts until your [[eidolon]]'s next turn, or until you are no longer adjacent to the [[eidolon]], whichever occurs first.
