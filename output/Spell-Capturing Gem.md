Description: A spell-capturing gem appears as a small chunk of azurite, lapis lazuli, or turquoise. This small blue gem is imbued with the [[power]] to capture a spell and make it available for later use. Once activated, a spell-capturing gem waits indefinitely for its owner to successfully counterspell a spell by using either dispel magic or other means. The gem's owner may then choose to capture the foiled spell in the gem, where it remains for a number of days equal to the owner's caster level minus the spell's spell level, minimum 1 day. (For example, if a 10th-level spellcaster successfully dispels and captures a fireball spell with this item, the spell could remain in the gem for up to 7 days.) At any time during that period, the wielder of the gem may use it to cast the captured spell, regardless of whether she would normally be able to do so. A spell cast in this way uses the minimum caster level necessary to determine all level-dependent effects. A spell-capturing gem is a single-use item. Once the captured spell has been released or once the storage duration of the gem is reached, the gem loses its sheen and turns gray, becoming a worthless pebble.
