name: [[Tangle Feet]]
type: Combat
description: Creatures who cross your path find themselves tripping over their own feet.
prerequisites: [[Dodge]], [[Mobility]], [[Underfoot]] (Advanced Player's Guide 173), goblin, Small size or smaller.
prerequisite_feats: [[Dodge]], [[Mobility]], [[Underfoot]]
benefit: When you successfully make an [[Acrobatic]]s check to avoid provoking an attack of opportunity from a larger opponent when you move through its threatened area or its space, you can make that opponent lose its balance until the end of its next turn as a free action. While that creature's balance is lost, if it attempts to move, it must make a successful DC 15 [[Acrobatic]]s check or fall prone, wasting the move action. You can only affect one creature with this effect each round.
