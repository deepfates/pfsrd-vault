Name: [[Levitating Land Mine]]
Aura: faint transmutation
CL: 5
Slot: item
Price: 750 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: Once the command word is spoken, this steel disc burrows 3 inches into the ground. To find it, a character with the [[trapfinding]] ability must succeed at a DC 25 Perception check. [[Plant]]ing the mine is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Once the mine is set, any creature that steps into its square must succeed at a DC 14 Will save or the mine levitates the creature 5 inches above the ground. A levitated creature can attack but not move, is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC, and takes a -4 penalty to CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition combat maneuvers. [[Fly]]ing creatures are immune. The creature can attempt a new save each round to end the effect. The effect ends after 5 rounds, with a successful DC 25 Disable Device check, or with a successful saving throw. The land mine is destroyed when the effect ends.
