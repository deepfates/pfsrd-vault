name: [[Sympathetic [[Rage]]]]
type: Combat
description: Seeing an ally enter a rage causes you to enter a rage-like state.
prerequisites: Half-orc or orc, non-lawful.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who is raging, you may choose to enter a similar but less [[power]]ful rage as a free action on your turn. This weaker rage gives you all the benefits and penalties of a rage, except your morale bonus to Strength and Constitution is only +2. There is no limit to how long you can rage, as long as you remain adjacent to a raging ally (for example, you could take a 5-foot step away from one raging ally toward another raging ally and maintain your rage). As with a [[barbarian]]'s rage, when this weaker rage ends, you are fatigued.
