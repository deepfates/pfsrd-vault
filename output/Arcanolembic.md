Name: [[Arcanolembic]]
Aura: moderate transmutation
CL: 10
Slot: item
Price: 5,000 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: This glass flask looks similar to the alembics used by [[alchemist]]s to distill various liquids, but this one is framed in a delicate silver brace and the glass is etched with various arcane runes. When used to create an alchemical object, the arcanolembic allows the creator to double her progress for 1 day's work (although this does not affect the cost or the price of the components of the object). In addition, when used to brew a potion, the arcanolembic reduces the time needed to create the potion by 25%. Finally, the arcanolembic can be used to hold one potion. When a creature consumes a potion from the arcanolembic, the potion is treated as if the caster level were 2 higher than the usual minimum for a potion of its level. Placing a potion into the arcanolembic is a full-round action. While holding a potion, the arcanolembic cannot be used for any other purpose.
