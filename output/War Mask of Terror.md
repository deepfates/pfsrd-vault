Name: [[War Mask of Terror]]
Aura: moderate necromancy
CL: 9
Slot: head
Price: 9,000 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: [[Shaman]]s and warriors of many of the indigenous tribes of western Garund add to their fierceness and mystique by wearing wooden masks that bear terrifying visages of demonic [[spirits]]. A war mask is considered sacred and personal, and is often handed down to the next generation when a wearer dies. Individual masks are often notorious, and many tribesfolk can readily identify masks of other tribes with a DC 15 Knowledge (local) check. A war mask of terror provides its wearer with a +2 competence bonus on Intimidate checks and a +1 deflection bonus to Armor Class. In addition, the wearer may cast scare once per day. Other war masks exist with different abilities; some have higher deflection bonuses, while others can cast bull's strength, fear, or flesh to stone instead of scare.
