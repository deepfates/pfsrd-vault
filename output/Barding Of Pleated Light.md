Name: [[[[Bard]]ing Of Pleated [[Light]]]]
Aura: overwhelming abjuration
CL: 20
Slot: [[armor]] ([[bard]]ing)
Price: 0
Weight: 100 lbs.
Description: The [[bard]]ing of pleated light was crafted by angels in service to Pulura, the Shimmering Maiden, an empyreal lord once venerated by the conquered people of Sarkoris. This ornately crafted mithral full plate [[armor]] resizes to fit a horse, warhorse, or equivalent mount that it is placed upon. It acts as +2 greater spell resistance (19) full plate [[bard]]ing. The [[bard]]ing of pleated light grants additional [[power]]s related to the rippling light of an aurora. These [[power]]s can be activated by the wearer's rider; the wearer can activate the [[bard]]ing's [[power]]s only if it has an Intelligence score of 3 or greater. First, the [[bard]]ing can be activated as the blinding shield special ability at will, but the wearer and the wearer's rider are both immune to this blinding effect. Second, as an immediate action, the [[armor]] can be activated to divert harmful light or shadows. This grants the [[armor]]'s spell resistance to the wearer's rider for 1 round, but this spell resistance only protects against spells with the light or shadow descriptor. Finally, the [[armor]] allows the wearer to pass through shimmering curtains of light. As an immediate action when charging, the [[armor]] can be activated to select any 10-foot-square area in the path of the charge. A curtain of multicolored light appears momentarily on each side of this area. The wearer can charge across this area as though it did not exist, disappearing into a ripple of light on one side and reappearing in a ripple of light on the other side. The wearer ignores terrain or obstacles in the intervening area (allowing the wearer to charge through allies in the area, for example), and the intervening area does not count toward the wearer's charge movement. The ripple of light cannot be used for movement by anyone except the wearer and the wearer's rider.
