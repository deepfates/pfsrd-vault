name: [[Efreeti Touch]]
type: Combat
description: Your knowledge of the secrets of the burning wind and blazing sun allows you to collect flames into your hands and unleash them in a gout of elemental fire.
prerequisites: Con 15, Wis 17, [[Efreeti Style]], [[Efreeti Stance]], [[Elemental Fist]]**, [[Improved Unarmed Strike]], base attack bonus +13 or [[monk]] level 11th.
prerequisite_feats: [[Efreeti Style]], [[Efreeti Stance]], [[Elemental Fist]], [[Improved Unarmed Strike]]
benefit: While using [[Efreeti Style]], as a standard action, you can spend two [[Elemental Fist]] (Advanced Player's Guide 158) attempts to unleash a 15-foot coneshaped burst of flame. Creatures caught in the cone take your unarmed strike damage plus the fire damage from your [[Elemental Fist]] and catch on fire. A successful Ref lex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modif ier) reduces the damage by half and prevents a target from catching on fire.
