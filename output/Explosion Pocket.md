Name: [[Explosion Pocket]]
Aura: faint evocation
CL: 1
Slot: item
Price: 3,000 gp
Weight: 1/2 lb.
Description: An explosion pocket looks like a cloth pouch just large enough to contain a Small or [[Medium]] humanoid's hand. When placed against a shirt, vest, jacket, trousers, or similar piece of clothing, this ragged green patch attaches to the clothing, creating a loose pocket. The pocket functions as a normal pocket, but once per day the pocket's wearer can, as a standard action by speaking a command word while his hand is in the pocket, cause the pocket to create a single vial of [[alchemist]]'s fire. If a vial of [[alchemist]]'s fire is in the explosion pocket when it is commanded to create a vial of [[alchemist]]'s fire, the pocket instead supercharges the existing vial within so that it inflicts double the normal fire damage a vial of [[alchemist]]'s fire would normally inflict. An explosion pocket can be removed as a full-round action, allowing it to be placed on a different piece of clothing as the owner wishes. A vial of [[alchemist]]'s fire created or supercharged by an explosion pocket reverts to a vial of inert bitter-tasting water 1 minute after it is created or supercharged.
