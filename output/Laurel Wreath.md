Name: [[Laurel Wreath]]
Aura: faint enchantment
CL: 5
Slot: head
Price: 19,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: This crown of laurel leaves inspires its wearer to achieve mighty deeds. She gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If she succeeds at a saving throw against a harmful mind-affecting effect, the surge of confidence gives her a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, skill checks, and weapon damage rolls for 1 minute. If she fails such a saving throw, she is instead shaken for 1 minute, though this condition doesn't stack with other fear effects to make her frightened or panicked. A mythic creature wearing the wreath gains 2 temporary hit points per tier at the start of each day. These temporary hit points are restored whenever the wearer rests 8 hours or otherwise gains the equivalent of doing so.
