Name: [[Khepresh Of [[Refuge]]]]
Aura: strong abjuration
CL: 15
Slot: head
Price: 63,000 gp
Weight: 3 lbs.
Description: This traditional Osirian crown-known as a khepresh, or "war crown"-made of hardened blue leather and adorned with discs of blue-tinted electrum and a rearing, hooded cobra of gold, was crafted specifically for the Sky Pharaoh Hakotep I. The khepresh of refuge grants its wearer a +3 deflection bonus to AC and fire resistance 10. In addition, the crown has 3 charges per day. When struck by a critical hit or sneak attack, the wearer can spend 1 charge as an immediate action to negate the critical hit or sneak attack (as the fortification [[armor]] special ability, but without requiring a roll). The damage is instead rolled normally. Alternatively, the wearer can spend 1 charge as an immediate action to reroll a failed saving throw. He must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse.
Requirements: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], moment of prescience, resist energy, shield of faith
