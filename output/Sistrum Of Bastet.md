Description: The Sistrum of Bastet is a [[power]]ful artifact that, when used properly, allows a [[bard]] to use her [[bard]]ic performance ability to enhance the spells of a divine spellcaster or conceal her true motives. Once per day, when the wielder uses the Sistrum of Bastet as part of a [[bard]]ic performance, she can inspire a divine spellcaster within range of the performance and bolster the effects of any spells that spellcaster casts. Thereafter, for the duration of the performance, whenever the designated divine caster chooses to cast a spell, the [[bard]] can expend 1 or more rounds of [[bard]]ic performance as an immediate action to enhance her allied divine spellcaster's spell as if that individual had prepared it with the [[Heighten Spell]] Metamagic Feat. The number of levels by which the divine spell is heightened is determined by the number of rounds of [[bard]]ic performance sacrificed. For example, if the sistrum's player sacrifices 2 rounds of [[bard]]ic performance, the divine caster's spell level increases by 2. A spell's level can never increase beyond 9th level, and can't be higher than the divine caster can cast. Second, a [[bard]] wielding the Sistrum of Bastet can conceal the activity of casting a [[bard]] spell by masking it in a performance. As a swift action, the [[bard]] can combine her casting time for a spell with a Perform check. Observers must succeed at a Perception or Sense Motive check opposed by the user's Perform check to realize she is also casting a spell. This uses 1 round of her [[bard]]ic performance ability, regardless of the spell's casting time. In addition, a [[bard]] using the Sistrum of Bastet can select a number of creatures equal to her level. The [[bard]] can deliver secret messages to these individuals without needing to use the Bluff skill. The [[bard]] still must be able to speak to deliver the message. Finally, when the wielder gains a [[bard]] level and is able to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows, she can choose a spell from the [[cleric]] spell list. This spell must be of the same level as the spell that she is replacing, and the [[bard]] casts that spell as a divine spell. If the Sistrum of Bastet ever leaves her possession for longer than 24 hours, any divine spells added in this way are lost unless she can reclaim the instrument.
