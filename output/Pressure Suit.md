Name: [[Pressure Suit]]
Aura: faint abjuration
CL: 5
Slot: body and helm (see text)
Price: 4,000 gp
Weight: 30 lbs.
Description: This magical full-body suit completely protects the wearer from temperature extremes (as if by endure elements) and pressure dangers of hard vacuum and all [[world]]s in the system (save the sun), though it only carries enough air for 3 days before it must be recharged in breathable atmosphere (such as that inside a ship). If the suit's seal is broken-such as the helmet being removed to eat or drink-all the air escapes in 2d6 rounds. A suit with a broken seal confers only the benefits of endure elements. The suit automatically repairs small holes, but if it is struck by a critical hit from a piercing or slashing weapon, the wearer of the pressure suit must succeed at a Reflex save (DC equal to the opponent's confirmation roll) or the seal breaks. A suit with a broken seal can be repaired with a DC 18 Craft ([[armor]]) check or a make whole spell. The suit does not compensate for changes in gravity. Wearing a pressure suit imposes a -1 [[armor]] check penalty; this penalty stacks with those provided by other equipment (such as [[armor]]). Since it takes up both the body and helm slots, [[armor]] can be worn over a pressure suit, but robes and helms cannot.
