Slot: item
Price: 600 gp

Description: This shimmering black dust causes one creature to be coated in a layer of darkness for 1 minute. In normal light, the creature gains concealment (20% miss chance). In dim light, the creature gains total concealment (50% miss chance). It has no effect in areas of bright light or darkness (though in bright light, a viewer can make a DC 20 Perception check to notice the target is slightly shadowed). Creatures with darkvision see through the dust's darkness as if it were normal darkness. The dust dispels and counters the outlining effects of glitterdust, but doesn't affect the spell's blinding effects. [[Glitterdust]] dispels and counters the effects of the dust of darkness.
