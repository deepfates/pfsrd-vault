Weight: 10 lbs.
Description: This +1 scythe has five onyx gems set into its blade. A creature with the ability to channel negative energy can expend one use of that ability to charge the weapon with [[power]], causing one onyx gem per 1d6 points of channeled energy to glow (multiple channels do not stack; the wielder must be able to channel 5d6 points of negative energy to activate all five gems). Anytime the wielder deals damage to a creature with the scythe, he can activate one charged gem as a swift action, releasing its energy and dealing 1d6 points of channeled negative energy damage to the target. Alternatively, as a standard action the wielder can touch the scythe to a willing creature healed by negative energy (such as undead) and release any number of stored charges, each of which heals the target for 1d6 points of damage.
Requirements: [[Craft Magic Arms and Armor]], creator must be able to channel negative energy
