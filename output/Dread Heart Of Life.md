Description: A boon to vampires on long sea voyages or visiting desolate locations, the throbbing heart in this black box can store the life energy of a creature for later consumption. When a vampire carrying the box makes a successful drain attack, it can redirect the stolen essence to the heart, harming the target creature but granting the vampire no immediate benefit from the feeding. The essence remains stored in the heart for 1 week; at any time, the vampire may clutch the heart as a standard action to drain the essence from it and thus gain the benefits of feeding.
