name: [[Animal]] Ally
type: General
description: Your respect for nature is so great that you can form a deep and lasting friendship with an animal.
prerequisites: [[Nature Soul]], character level 4th, must not have an animal companion or mount that advances as an animal companion.
prerequisite_feats: [[Nature Soul]]
benefit: You gain an animal companion as if you were a [[druid]] of your character level -3 from the following list: badger, bird, camel, cat (small), dire rat, dog, horse, pony, snake (viper), or wolf. If you later gain an animal companion through another source (such as the [[Animal]] domain, divine bond, hunter's bond, mount, or nature bond class features), the effective [[druid]] level granted by this feat stacks with that granted by other sources.
