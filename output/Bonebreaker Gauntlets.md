Name: [[[[Bonebreaker]] Gauntlets]]
Aura: faint necromancy
CL: 5
Slot: wrists
Price: 6,000 gp
Weight: 2 lbs.
Description: These thick brass and leather gauntlets allow the wearer to tear through bone and muscle like paper. Once per day, as part of a melee attack, the wearer can activate the gauntlets to inflict a horrific injury on an opponent. If the attack hits, the target must make a DC 14 Will save. If the save fails, the Wand reduces the target's Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution (wearer's choice) by -6. This penalty cannot reduce the target's ability score below 1. The injury heals over time, reducing the penalty by 1 for each day that passes since the time of the injury, and is immediately removed by heal, regenerate, restoration, or any magic that can break a curse.
