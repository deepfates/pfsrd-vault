Name: [[Bag Of Holding Type I]]I
Aura: moderate conjuration
CL: 9
Slot: item
Price: 5,000 gp
Weight: 15+ lbs.
Description: This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The bag of holding opens into a nondimensional space: its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. This weight, and the limits in weight and volume of the bag's contents, depend on the bag's type, as shown on the table below. BAG CONTENTS CONTENTS BAG WeightLIMIT VOLUME LIMIT Price Type I 15 lbs. 250 lbs. 30 cubic ft. 2,500 gp Type II 25 lbs. 500 lbs. 70 cubic ft. 5,000 gp Type III 35 lbs. 1,000 lbs. 150 cubic ft. 7,400 gp Type IV 60 lbs. 1,500 lbs. 250 cubic ft. 10,000 gp If a bag of holding is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag immediately ruptures and is ruined, and all contents are lost forever. If a bag of holding is turned inside out, all of its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a bag of holding is a move action, unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. Magic items placed inside the bag do not offer any benefit to the character carrying the bag. If a bag of holding is placed within a portable hole, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a portable hole is placed within a bag of holding, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: the hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the portable hole and bag of holding in the process.
