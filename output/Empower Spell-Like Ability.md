type: Monster
description: One of this creature's spell-like abilities is particularly potent and [[power]]ful.
prerequisites: Spell-like ability at caster level 6th or higher.
prerequisite_feats: 0
benefit: Choose one of the creature's spell-like abilities, subject to the restrictions below. The creature can use that ability as an em[[power]]ed spell-like ability three times per day (or less, if the ability is normally usable only once or twice per day). When a creature uses an em[[power]]ed spell-like ability, all variable, numeric effects of the spell-like ability are increased by half (+50%). Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected. Spell-like abilities without random variables are not affected. The creature can only select a spell-like ability duplicating a spell with a level less than or equal to 1/2 its caster level (round down) - 2. For a summary, see the table in the description of the [[Quicken Spell]]-Like Ability feat on page 316.
