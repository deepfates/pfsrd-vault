name: [[Iconoclast]]
type: Combat
description: You know how to turn a holy symbol into a weapon against her followers.
prerequisites: [[Divine Defiance]], [[Improved Sunder]], [[Power Attack]], Intimidate 3 ranks.
prerequisite_feats: [[Divine Defiance]], [[Improved Sunder]], [[Power Attack]]
benefit: When you succeed at a sunder combat maneuver against a holy or unholy symbol, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize as a free action. This demoralization affects all followers of the deity or philosophy whose symbol you sundered who saw you sunder it and are within 30 feet. If you destroyed the symbol, you gain a +5 bonus on your Intimidate check. You can use this feat when sundering any physical holy symbol-it doesn't have to be the hand-held variety commonly used by [[cleric]]s and other divine spellcasters.
