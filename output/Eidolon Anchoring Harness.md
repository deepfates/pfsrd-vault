Name: [[Eidolon Anchoring Harness]]
Aura: moderate abjuration
CL: 7
Slot: body
Price: 6,000 gp
Weight: 1 lb.
Description: Loadstone studs line the straps of this ornate leather harness. When worn by an [[eidolon]], the bindings act as a dimensional safety harness, anchoring the outsider to its current plane. Any time the [[eidolon]] would be forced to return to its home plane (such as when it's reduced to negative hit points equal to its Constitution score or when its master is rendered unconscious), it can expend one use of its [[summoner]]'s summon monster spell-like ability as a free action to remain on the Material Plane for 1 round. The [[summoner]] does not need to be conscious for the [[eidolon]] to use this ability, but he must be within 100 feet. If the [[summoner]] is conscious, he can refuse to allow this expenditure (which means the [[eidolon]] is forced back to its home plane). If the condition that would have sent the [[eidolon]] back to its home plane is still in effect after 1 round has passed, the [[eidolon]] may expend another use of its master's summon monster spell-like ability; otherwise it immediately returns to its home plane.
