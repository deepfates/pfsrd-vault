      "Description: A folding boat looks like a small wooden box about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep when it is inactive. In this mode, it can be used to store items just like any other box. Yet when the proper command word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold even further into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The folding boat cannot unfold if there isn't enough open space for it to occupy once unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship. In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen [[sai]]l. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a rudder, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square [[sai]]l. The boat can hold 4 people comfortably, while the ship carries 15 with ease. A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again, but only when it is unoccupied.\n",

Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to \"swallowing'' if thrust within the bag. The bag of devouring is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusion, but anytime thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60% likely to close around the offending member and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has a +8 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to grapple. If it pins a creature, it pulls them inside as a free action. The bag has CMD of 18 for those attempting to break free. The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a bag of holding type I, but each hour it has a 5% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or resurrection that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a wish, miracle, or true resurrection spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature.

      "Description: This item is indistinguishable in appearance from a normal broom. It is identical to a broom of flying by all tests short of attempted use. If a creature attempts to fly using the broom, the broom does a loop-the-loop with its hopeful rider, dumping him on his head from 1d4+5 feet off the ground (no falling damage, since the fall is less than 10 feet).

      "Description: A Chelish crux is similar to a bag of holding in that its interior space is larger than its exterior would suggest. When closed, a Chelish crux is a wooden and metal dodecahedron (similar in shape to a d12) that measures about 6 inches in diameter. Each face of the crux is carved with a different rune or image-in order to open the puzzle box, a person must trace the outlines of these runes and images with the tip of a finger in the proper order. Each time a rune is triggered in the correct order in this manner, it glows with a soft red light, but whenever a rune is triggered out of order, the light flashes into fire and inflicts 2 points of fire damage per currently lit rune on the person attempting to open the crux (Reflex DC 15 halves) and causes all lit faces to deactivate (forcing the process of opening it to start anew). Failure to open a crux eight times in a row causes the combination of runes to randomize to a new combination. You can simulate this puzzle for the PCs by determining the order in which the runes must be activated and then having the players stumble through the combinations, or you can allow a character a DC 35 Disable Device check or a DC 25 Intelligence check to try to open the puzzle box-each attempt takes 1 minute, and the check can be retried with a cumulative +1 bonus on the roll, to a maximum bonus of +7, after which the crux resets its order (at which point the bonus reverts to +0 and the character must start anew). Failure on either of these checks causes the crux to flash with fire and causes 2 points of fire damage (Reflex DC 15 halves), plus 2 points for each failure. A Chelish crux can be forced open with damage or a DC 28 Strength check. The crux has hardness 10 and 30 hit points. If a crux is forced open in either of these two ways, it explodes into a 10-foot-radius burst of fire, inflicting 3d6+6 points of fire damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 halves). The fire damage affects any objects held within the crux as well. If forced open, the crux crumbles to ashes and any objects it contains appear on the ground at the site of the fiery burst. Once a particular crux's combination is known, a character can open it automatically (this takes 3 consecutive full-round actions). Opened properly, the crux unfolds into a 2-foot-square flat sheet of metal and wood. Any objects the crux contains sit upon the center of the sheet. An unfolded crux automatically folds as soon as a character attempts to bend any of the sheet's four corners as a move-equivalent action. The crux automatically folds up around any objects that sit upon its face at this time-objects that would exceed the crux's capacity are pushed gently aside by the refolding action. A Chelish crux can hold up to 200 pounds of objects, but the physical size of each object is irrelevant-the sight of a crux folding up around a long polearm, for example, might make one assume the weapon was crushed and destroyed, but when the crux is next opened, the pole arm is unharmed. As an object that creates an extradimensional space, a Chelish crux functions as a bag of holding for determining how long a living creature within can survive, or for what happens when the crux is placed in another extradimensional object like a portable hole (see Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook, page 500)\n",

      "Description: Grave candles are magical candles that draw forth [[spirits]] from the mortal remains of long-dead creatures, allowing the living to speak to them for a short period of time while the candle's wick burns. In order to function, a grave candle must be placed amid the physical remains of the body to be spoken to. These remains can be partial, or even just a handful of ash or grave dust, but a totally destroyed body (as results from destruction or disintegrate) doesn't leave enough material for a grave candle to function. When it's lit, the smoke rising from the candle grows thick, and a ghostly shape similar to the creature's appearance in life manifests in the smoke. At this point, the manifested spirit (which is as much an echo of the creature as it is the actual departed soul) can speak-a grave candle does not impart any additional understanding of languages. In other respects, the conversation with the dead spirit adheres to the rules for speak with dead (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 346), save that the dead spirit receives a -4 penalty on its saving throw to resist the spell. Furthermore, a dead body can only be successfully subjected to a grave candle once-the burning of the candle \"burns out\" the latent necromantic and spiritual energy left behind by the soul's parting from the [[world]] (this does not harm the actual soul of the dead spirit).\n",

      "Description: Horticulturists harvest this magical dye from the pulp of rare plants found only in the lushest regions of Tian Xia. Bisby first encountered this dye while visiting the royal courts of the [[Miracle]] [[Samurai]] during his early adventures as a Pathfinder. He made a point of returning with several bottles, and the decision served him well over the next several decades. Truecolor dye produces vibrant colors, yet the actual color that registers varies according to the personality and temperment of the viewer-the viewer's good, neutral, or evil alignment component determines the color he sees. Good viewers see a pleasing gold, while evil viewers see a rich blood red. A neutral viewer sees the dye as its actual color, a dull orange. Centuries ago, truecolor dye was used in the miracle courts of Tian Xia as a way to trick emissaries into revealing their alignments, but its secret has long since been disseminated on the eastern continent and lost its hidden value. A DC 25 Knowledge (geography or nature) check reveals the dye's nature. A single vial of truecolor dye is enough to coat a square foot of material, or to ink 5 pages of text. Once applied, truecolor dye is permanent, although it can be washed off with universal solvent.\n",

It generates a constant field of mental static that grants the wearer a +1 bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting effects. The wearer may generate an attack similar to the spell shout, though the sound is mental, and thus does not affect items or creatures immune to mind-affecting effects, and its damage is not affected by sonic vulnerability, resistance, or immunity. In addition, as part of the attack, the wearer may make a DC 20 Charisma check to shape a specific noise or message of five words or fewer. These sounds are purely mental and not heard by any creature outside the area of effect. The wearer may use this effect 1d3 times per day. The GM determines how many times per day the clasp of the mind scream can be used.

It generates a constant field of mental static that grants the wearer a +1 bonus on Will saves against mind-affecting effects. The wearer may generate an attack similar to the spell <i>shout,</i> though the sound is mental, and thus does not affect items or creatures immune to mind-affecting effects, and its damage is not affected by sonic vulnerability, resistance, or immunity. In addition, as part of the attack, the wearer may make a DC 20 Charisma check to shape a specific noise or message of five words or fewer. These sounds are purely mental and not heard by any creature outside the area of effect. The wearer may use this effect 1d3 times per day. The GM determines how many times per day the <i>clasp of the mind scream</i> can be used. If the wearer attempts to use the clasp beyond this number of times, he is affected by its effects and the clasp is inert for the next 24 hours.</p></h4></div><hr/><div><h5><b>CONSTRUCTION</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Requirements </b>[[Craft Wondrous Item]], <i>detect thoughts</i>, <i>shout</i>; <b>Cost </b>6,400 gp</h5></div>\n",

Thus, for one user it might be a +2 bane vs. humanoids (humans) longbow, while for another it might be a +2 bane vs. dragons longbow. A wielder can do nothing to change the bow's bane effect. In addition, once per week, felhart's wielder can summon a reliable steed as per the spell mount. This creature takes the form of a lean, swift white elk that, despite its almost ghostly appearance, possesses the same statistics as a horse. This creature allows felhart's wielder to ride it, and serves loyally for up to 5 hours, vanishing at the end of this time. The mount will not allow any creature beside felhart's wielder to ride it unless the weapon's bearer succeeds at a DC 16 Handle [[Animal]] check. Even if this check succeeds, the mount only allows another rider to ride along with the weapon bearer. The elk never allows a strange rider to ride it alone.\n",

In addition, once per day as a free action, the wearer can cause the mask to warp and contort ferociously, causing a single creature within 15 feet to make a DC 14 Will save or become frightened.

      "Description: Typically found in sets of three, these clay jars are decorated with the heads of animals and monsters. Though they once likely contained the preserved viscera of ancient Osirian scholars, nobles, and priests, the jars now hold little more than dust. Their true value lies in the benefits they provide spellcasters seeking to transpose their souls via the spell magic jar. Osirian spirit jars serve as [[focus]] items for the spell magic jar, forgoing the spell's need for another [[focus]]. All three jars function in this way, allowing a caster to move his soul or that of a nearby target into any one of the three jars, or his own soul between jars and bodies as he pleases. The jars do not allow him to shuffle souls other than his own into different bodies, though he can shift souls between jars. Souls within Osirian spirit jars are permanently affected by magic jar, and can potentially be kept trapped within forever. A caster can only move his soul between bodies while his casting of magic jar is in effect. If his spell expires while he is within an Osirian spirit jar, his soul and those in the other jars are trapped. A soul within an Osirian spirit jar can be freed by opening the jar, allowing the spirit within to try to swap souls with that of the jar's holder as per the spell magic jar (a DC 17 Will save to resist), or return to its body if it is within range. Alternatively, casting magic jar on an Osirian spirit jar containing a spirit, rather than an individual creature, allows that spirit to swap bodies as if it were the target of the spell. Should a spirit within an Osirian spirit jar no longer have a body or be outside its jar when its magic jar spell ends, it returns to one of the empty Osirian spirit jars if one is in range, or dies if one is not.\n",

A particular feather token has no specific features to identify it unless its magic aura is viewed-even tokens with identical [[power]]s can be wildly different in appearance. Fan: A token that forms a huge flapping fan, causing a breeze of sufficient strength to propel one ship (about 25 mph). This wind is not cumulative with existing wind speed. The token can, however, be used to lessen existing winds, creating an area of relative calm or lighter winds (but wave size in a storm is not affected). The fan can be used for up to 8 hours. It does not function on land.\n",

Once per day on command, a pearl of [[power]] enables the possessor to recall any one spell that she had prepared and then cast that day. The spell is then prepared again, just as if it had not been cast. The spell must be of a particular level, depending on the pearl. Different pearls exist for recalling one spell per day of each level from 1st through 9th and for the recall of two spells per day (each of a different level, 6th or lower).\n",

The eye is a socket for an ioun stone; when filled, you may activate the wayfinder when you sleep or meditate to create a mobile illusory image of yourself that is partly real. You control the image as if it were your own body and perceive things through it as if it had all of your normal senses plus darkvision with a range of 60 feet. You do not need to maintain line of sight to the image. The image is visible but transparent, and it cannot perform any action that an unseen servant is unable to perform. The image has 40% of your hit points at the time it was created. Its AC is 10 + your size modifier + your Dexterity modifier. It uses your current Will saving throw bonus but automatically fails Fortitude and Reflex saves. It is destroyed if brought to 0 hit points, which deals you 2d4 points of Charisma damage. It can be dispelled, and cannot enter areas warded against summoned creatures, your alignment, illusions, or incorporeal creatures. You may end this ability as a free action, and it ends automatically if you are awakened, your body is attacked, or 8 hours pass; ending the image in this manner does not deal you Charisma damage. Using this ability drains energy from the slotted ioun stone, rendering it dull gray and [[power]]less for 24 hours. A dull gray ioun stone cannot [[power]] the projection ability of this wayfinder.

Detect magic does not detect that it is magical (as per the magic aura spell), but the pouch acts as a very small bag of holding (contents limit 10 pounds, volume limit 2 cubic feet). With a command word, the wearer can close or open the extradimensional space within the pouch; when closed, the pouch holds no more than a mundane belt pouch the size of a human fist, though objects within the extradimensional space remain stored, unreachable until the pouch is unsealed again. This allows the user to empty his pockets or even turn the pouch inside-out to prove he carries no contraband, and access the hidden goods later when in a safe place. Because of their nonmagical auras, these pouches sometimes hold secret treasures for generations without their owners realizing their nature.\n",

      "Description: This dark stone sometimes appears to be made of transparent crystal filled nearly to the brim with dark ink. It provides the benefits of an iridescent spindle (sustains you without air), pearly white spindle (regenerate 1 hit point per 10 minutes), and an orange prism (+1 caster level). However, it has two drawbacks. First, once set loose to orbit your head, it dislikes being contained (including being placed in a wayfinder) and frees itself to orbit again 1d4+1 hours after being removed from its spinning path. Second, it drains the [[power]] out of other ioun stones, rendering them dull gray and [[power]]less at a rate of one every 24 hours. Thus, it is an excellent and valuable item if you only have one ioun stone, but hard to conceal and dangerous to your other treasures. A remove curse or similar spell can put the stone at rest and prevent it from returning to its orbit. The Society has at least three specimens of this type locked in the Vaults to prevent ignorant Pathfinders from ruining perfectly good ioun stones. In theory you could place one directly into a wayfinder rather than ever letting it orbit, though conflicting reports suggest the sepia ellipsoid may be able to drain [[power]] out of orbiting stones even when contained in this way.

The goat can travel for a maximum of 1 day each week-continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for no less than 1 day before it can again be used. • The Goat of Travail: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare (see the Pathfinder RPG Bestiary) except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time. • The Goat of Terror: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount with the statistics of a light horse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a +3 heavy lance, the other as a +5 longsword). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every 2 weeks for up to 3 hours per use.\n",

Treat it as a heavy horse with the following additional [[power]]s usable once per round at will: overland flight, plane shift, and ethereal jaunt. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit.

Once that occurs, the owner instantly knows the [[power]]s of the prayer beads and understands how to activate the strand's special magical beads. Each strand includes two or more special beads, each with a different magic [[power]] selected from the following list. Special Bead Type Special Bead Ability Bead of blessing Wearer can cast bless. Bead of healing Wearer can cast his choice of cure serious wounds, remove blindness/ deafness, or remove disease. Bead of karma Wearer casts his spells at +4 caster level. Effect lasts 10 minutes. Bead of smiting Wearer can cast chaos hammer, holy smite, order's wrath, or unholy blight (Will DC 17 partial). Bead of summons Summons a [[power]]ful creature of appropriate alignment from the Outer Planes (an angel, devil, etc.) to aid the wearer for 1 day. (If the wearer uses the bead of summons to summon a deity's emissary frivolously, the deity takes that character's items and places a geas upon him as punishment at the very least.) Bead of wind walking Wearer can cast wind walk. A lesser strand of prayer beads has a bead of blessing and a bead of healing. A strand of prayer beads has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, and a bead of smiting. A greater strand of prayer beads has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, a bead of summons, and a bead of wind walking. Each special bead can be used once per day, except for the bead of summons, which works only once and then becomes nonmagical. The beads of blessing, smiting, and wind walking function as spell trigger items; the beads of karma and summons can be activated by any character capable of casting divine spells. The owner need not hold or wear the strand of prayer beads in any specific location, as long as he carries it somewhere on his person. The [[power]] of a special bead is lost if it is removed from the strand. Reduce the price of a strand of prayer beads that is missing one or more beads by the following amounts: bead of blessing -600 gp, bead of healing -9,000 gp, bead of karma -20,000 gp, bead of smiting -16,800 gp, bead of summons -20,000 gp, bead of wind walking -46,800 gp.\n",

      "Description: This item appears to be nothing more than a string of prayer beads until the owner casts a divine spell while the beads are carried. Once that occurs, the owner instantly knows the [[power]]s of the prayer beads and understands how to activate the strand's special magical beads. Each strand includes two or more special beads, each with a different magic [[power]] selected from the following list. Special Bead Type Special Bead Ability Bead of blessing Wearer can cast bless. Bead of healing Wearer can cast his choice of cure serious wounds, remove blindness/ deafness, or remove disease. Bead of karma Wearer casts his spells at +4 caster level. Effect lasts 10 minutes. Bead of smiting Wearer can cast chaos hammer, holy smite, order's wrath, or unholy blight (Will DC 17 partial). Bead of summons Summons a [[power]]ful creature of appropriate alignment from the Outer Planes (an angel, devil, etc.) to aid the wearer for 1 day. (If the wearer uses the bead of summons to summon a deity's emissary frivolously, the deity takes that character's items and places a geas upon him as punishment at the very least.) Bead of wind walking Wearer can cast wind walk. A lesser strand of prayer beads has a bead of blessing and a bead of healing. A strand of prayer beads has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, and a bead of smiting. A greater strand of prayer beads has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, a bead of summons, and a bead of wind walking. Each special bead can be used once per day, except for the bead of summons, which works only once and then becomes nonmagical. The beads of blessing, smiting, and wind walking function as spell trigger items; the beads of karma and summons can be activated by any character capable of casting divine spells. The owner need not hold or wear the strand of prayer beads in any specific location, as long as he carries it somewhere on his person. The [[power]] of a special bead is lost if it is removed from the strand. Reduce the price of a strand of prayer beads that is missing one or more beads by the following amounts: bead of blessing -600 gp, bead of healing -9,000 gp, bead of karma -20,000 gp, bead of smiting -16,800 gp, bead of summons -20,000 gp, bead of wind walking -46,800 gp.\n",

Only the person a bag of concealment is keyed to may access its contents. Any others who look in the bag see only the inside of an empty sack, with dimensions matching the bag's outside measurements, as the true contents are kept separate and undetectable in the bag's magical pocket dimension. Should anything be placed in the empty bag by someone other than the owner, the goods that have been shunted to the pocket dimension cannot be accessed unless the new item is removed. A bag of concealment registers as nonmagical unless successfully identified, as per a permanent version of the spell magic aura.

The bag behaves as a bag of holding, with all the same carrying capacities according to size, except for a few key points.

Only the person a bag of concealment is keyed to may access its contents. Any others who look in the bag see only the inside of an empty sack, with dimensions matching the bag's outside measurements, as the true contents are kept separate and undetectable in the bag's magical pocket dimension. Should anything be placed in the empty bag by someone other than the owner, the goods that have been shunted to the pocket dimension cannot be accessed unless the new item is removed. A bag of concealment registers as nonmagical unless successfully identified, as per a permanent version of the spell magic aura.

      "Description: This crystalline blue-white staff fell from the sky during a dazzling display of falling stars. Sages believe it was once part of an enormous piece of ice drifting between [[world]]s since the dawn of time, only coming to the [[world]] on a quirk of chance. Though as hard as crystal, the staff feels like wet ice, is cold to the touch, and gives the impression of great age. It slowly sinks in fresh or salt water (unlike true ice, which floats), and while it creates a cocoon of ice around itself when submerged, it is only after several hours that this coating is thick enough to cause the staff to bob to the surface. The staff's [[power]]s (and the equivalent staff of the magi [[power]]s they replace) are: • ray of frost (detect magic, 0 charges) • reduce person (enlarge person, 0 charges) • cone of cold ( fireball, 1 charge) • freezing ray (knock, functions as scorching ray but deals cold damage, 1 charge) • water breathing (lightning bolt, 1 charge) • fly (passwall, 1 charge) • wall of ice (wall of fire, 1 charge) • teleport (passwall, 2 charges) • time stop (monster summoning IX, 2 charges) The staff otherwise has the normal [[power]]s and abilities of a staff of the magi. If it is broken in a retributive strike, the bearer has a 25% chance to be held in stasis somewhere (as imprisonment, no saving throw), a 25% chance to be transported to a random plane, and a 50% chance to be utterly destroyed.\n",

      "Description: A long wooden staff shod in iron and inscribed with sigils and runes of all types, this potent artifact contains many spell [[power]]s and other functions. Unlike a normal staff, a staff of the magi holds 50 charges and cannot be recharged normally. Some of its [[power]]s use charges, while others don't. A staff of the magi does not lose its [[power]]s if it runs out of charges. The following [[power]]s do not use charges: • Detect magic • Enlarge person (Fortitude DC 15 negates) • Hold portal • [[Light]] • Mage [[armor]] • Mage hand The following [[power]]s drain 1 charge per usage: • Dispel magic • [[Fireball]] (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half ) • Ice storm • [[Invisibility]] • [[Knock]] • [[Light]]ning bolt (10d6 damage, Reflex DC 17 half ) • [[Passwall]] • [[Pyrotechnics]] (Will or Fortitude DC 16 negates) • Wall of fire • [[Web]] These [[power]]s drain 2 charges per usage: • Monster summoning IX • Plane shift (Will DC 21 negates) • [[Telekinesis]] (400 lbs. maximum; Will DC 19 negates) A staff of the magi gives the wielder spell resistance 23. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a rod of absorption does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a rod of absorption does. Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.\n",

      "Description: A soul jar appears as a 1-foot-tall glass jar, often with a thick, black, wax plug. While a soul jar has no ability to capture souls, it can function as the material component for a trap the soul spell (but not as a [[focus]] for soul bind). If a soul jar is used with trap the soul as a trigger object, the spell can be cast on the soul jar without inscribing the target's name. This allows the soul jar to capture the soul of the next person to touch it, allowing the jar to be used as a devious trap. The creator of the soul jar and nonliving creatures can manipulate such a soul jar without fear. This variant method does allow the victim a DC 22 Will save to resist the effect. When a creature is trapped in a soul jar, its body and soul appear as a roiling cloud of glowing white smoke that provides dim light in a 20-foot radius. A creature that touches an occupied soul jar can communicate telepathically with its occupant. Opening a soul jar or smashing it on the ground releases the stored soul and returns it to life-although victims who have spent hundreds of years in a soul jar may well have gone mad. In any event, once a soul jar is used to capture a soul, it can never again be used for this purpose. Most soul jars are worth 5,000 gp and can thus trap a soul of up to 5 HD.

While a <i><i>soul</i> jar</i> has no ability to capture <i>soul</i>s, it can function as the material component for a <i>trap the <i>soul</i></i> spell (but not as a [[focus]] for <i>soul</i> bind). If a <i><i>soul</i> jar</i> is used with <i>trap the <i>soul</i></i> as a trigger object, the spell can be cast on the <i><i>soul</i> jar</i> without inscribing the target's name. This allows the <i><i>soul</i> jar</i> to capture the <i>soul</i> of the next person to touch it, allowing the jar to be used as a devious trap. The creator of the <i><i>soul</i> jar</i> and nonliving creatures can manipulate such a <i><i>soul</i> jar</i> without fear. This variant method does allow the victim a DC 22 Will save to resist the effect. When a creature is trapped in a <i><i>soul</i> jar</i>, its body and <i>soul</i> appear as a roiling cloud of glowing white smoke that provides dim light in a 20-foot radius. A creature that touches an occupied <i><i>soul</i> jar</i> can communicate telepathically with its occupant. Opening a <i><i>soul</i> jar</i> or smashing it on the ground releases the stored <i>soul</i> and returns it to life-although victims who have spent hundreds of years in a <i><i>soul</i> jar</i> may well have gone mad. In any event, once a <i><i>soul</i> jar</i> is used to capture a <i>soul</i>, it can never again be used for this purpose. Most <i><i>soul</i> jar</i>s are worth 5,000 gp and can thus trap a <i>soul</i> of up to 5 HD. Soul jars can be built to capture more [[power]]ful <i>soul</i>s, at an increase of 1,000 gp per additional HD.</p></h4></div><hr/><div><h5><b>CONSTRUCTION</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Requirements </b>[[Craft Wondrous Item]], <i>trap the soul</i>; <b>Cost </b>2,500 gp</h5></div>\n",

      "Description: An oculus of Abaddon is a potent artifact rumored to have been created by one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as a way to reward those who work as their agents on the Material Plane. More likely, these items were crafted by a [[power]]ful pre- Earthfall race that has long since moved on, leaving behind these dangerous artifacts to tempt mortals into serving the needs of the Horsemen. An oculus of Abaddon appears as a sphere of clear crystal that contains a pinpoint of flickering red light at its center. When held, the oculus feels warm to the touch and fills the holder with a sudden desire to pluck out an eye and place the oculus within the socket-this causes 1d8 points of damage, 1 point of bleed damage, and 2 points of Constitution damage. Once placed in an eye socket, the oculus can only be removed by ripping it free (causing the same amount of damage as the initial plucking). An oculus placed in an empty eye socket immediately heals all damage caused by plucking the previous eye out. Once placed, an oculus allows its new owner to utilize its [[power]]s, as listed below. • [[Darkvision]] to a range of 120 feet (constant) • True seeing once per day as a free action • Greater scrying three times per day • Planar binding once per week (only to summon natives of Abaddon, such as daemons or soul eaters) • Familiar farsight at will (if the user has a familiar or an animal companion, he may use clairaudience/clairvoyance to observe the [[world]] through his familiar, despite any intervening distance as long as he and the familiar are on the same plane) The oculus of Abaddon's greatest [[power]], though, is its haunting beckon. This ability is usable once per year, and allows the user to manipulate the minds of a huge number of targets, provided that the end goal of the manipulation is a tragic or otherwise horrific fate for those being manipulated. This functions as mass charm monster, but with a range of 1 mile, and establishes a telepathic link between the caster and all minds in that area. The effects are still language-dependant despite this telepathy-creatures without the ability to understand language (typically, creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or lower) are unaffected. All other creatures are automatically affected unless they have 6 or more HD, in which case they gain a DC 22 Will save to resist the effects. Spell resistance applies regardless of HD. The oculus of Abaddon is [[power]]fully neutral evil and possesses a limited and hateful intellect of its own. While not capable of communicating directly with its owner, it refuses to activate its [[power]]s for any user who is not neutral evil.\n",

      "Description: Created by the Arcanamirium, this plain wooden rod is capped with steel, with 10 buttons along its length; it looks rugged and is usually scratched and stained. Pushing any of the buttons is an action equivalent to drawing a weapon. Unless otherwise stated, pressing a button a second time reverts the rod to its basic form. The following functions have no limit on the number of times they can be employed. Brace/jack: The end caps flatten into 2-foot-diameter discs and the wooden haft extends up to 10 feet, creating a brace for a tunnel ceiling or lifting a heavy object 10 feet into the air. Bridge: The rod flattens and extends to 1 foot wide, 1 inch thick, and 12 feet long. This form can support 4,000 pounds. Climbing pole/ladder. A spike that can anchor in stone extrudes from one end, while the other sprouts three sharp hooks. The rod lengthens to anywhere between 5 and 50 feet in a single round. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, in staggered progression. The rod is firmly held by the spike and hooks and can bear up to 4,000 pounds. Crowbar: This functions like a normal crowbar. Drill: One metal cap extends to a drill-like point and begins to spin, easily drilling a 3-inch-diameter hole through 3 feet of wood or 1 foot of stone per minute. Mallet: Though not intended as a weapon, a character can attack with the rod in this form as if it were a [[Medium]] warhammer with a -2 penalty. Portable ram: This functions like a normal portable ram, except up to three people are needed to help the wielder. Saw: This works like a normal two-person saw. Shovel: Pressing this button makes the rod cycle between a short-handled shovel, a long-handled shovel, and its basic form. Wedge: One metal cap extends to form a flat chisel shape, such as for cutting wood or breaking stone (normally a hammer or mallet is used with it for this task).\n",

      "Description: This repugnant and cruel magic item consists of a chain of cold iron on which dangle six tiny, cold iron cages, each of which contains a living but miniaturized pixie. While the pixies are free to shriek and yell and cry, the item prevents them from taking any action that would directly free them from their cage and suppresses all of their supernatural and spell-like abilities. As a swift action, the wearer of a necklace of lovelies can redirect hit point damage inflicted on him from any single attack or effect that damages him onto one of the pixies on the necklace-doing so automatically kills the poor pixie in a tiny explosion of blood. Once all of the necklace's pixies are dead or released, the necklace becomes nonmagical. The magic of a necklace of lovelies can also be released by breaking open one of the tiny pixie cages (hardness 10; hp 10; Break DC 20). If the cage contains a living pixie, the grateful fey quickly escapes and returns to normal size-in so doing, the wash of energy allows the pixie to bestow luck upon the creature who broke that particular cage if the pixie so chooses (most pixies are grateful enough to a rescuer to automatically grant this boon). An instant after the luck is bestowed, the grateful pixie vanishes (presumably back to the area in which he or she was first imprisoned in the necklace during its creation). The luck granted by this effect can be used at any point once during the next 7 days as a swift action whenever a d20 is rolled-it allows the lucky soul to roll 2d20 and pick which result he wishes to accept.\n",

It has no effect when not mounted properly or when laying on the ground. It normally depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of a particular noble. A lord's banner may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the banner does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner. <i>Terror:</i> Enemies of the bearer of a lord's banner of terror, while within 30 feet and able to see the banner, must make a Will saving throw (DC 16) or become panicked, fleeing as quickly as possible for as long as they can see the banner. Those that succeed on the save are shaken. A creature that makes its saving throw is immune to the banner's effects for 1 day.</p></h4></div><hr/><div><h5><b>CONSTRUCTION</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Requirements </b>[[Craft Wondrous Item]], <i>heroism</i>; <b>Cost </b>37,500 gp</h5></div>\n",

Instead, it automatically causes him to take on the guise of someone known to and despised by those viewing him, complete with supplementary illusions that make that wearer appear disoriented, injured, or weak. For example, in a goblin lair, the wearer might look like the tribe's chief, but sleepy and vulnerable. In a human town, the wearer may look like the hated local bully, drunk and staggering. In an evil town, the wearer looks like a confused visitor and appears to be an ideal target to victimize with some crime. Curse-breaking magic is necessary to remove the hat.\n",

      "Description: A talisman of reluctant wishes appears the same as a stone of controlling earth elementals, a rugged rock that seems to pulse with an inner [[power]]. Its [[power]]s are quite different, however, and are dependent on the Charisma of the holder. Any character touching a talisman of reluctant wishes must make a DC 15 Charisma check. If the check fails, the talisman acts as a stone of weight (see page 543 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). Discarding it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman. If the check succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a wish is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears. If the check roll is a natural 20, the talisman remains for a number of months equal to the character's Charisma score, resisting any effort to get rid of it by reappearing in the character's possession, in a back pocket, at the bottom of his pack, or the like. The artifact grants one wish for every 6 points of the character's Charisma (round down). It grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.) Regardless of which reaction results, a talisman of reluctant wishes disappears when its time expires, leaving behind a large diamond in its stead, valued at 1,000 gp per point of the character's Charisma.\n",

      "Description: The [[Bottle of the Bound]] is an ancient brass bottle with a narrow neck and a rounded belly, slightly flattened on the bottom so it stands upright when resting on a table. The bottle's tight-fitting stopper is engraved with sigils of binding and sealed with lead. Legends say a [[wizard]] of tremendous [[power]] and wisdom enchanted a fiendish army and trapped it within the bottle for all time. The Legion of the Bound may be called forth from the bottle by its wielder and forced to serve, as they were once commanded to build a fantastic ancient city, long since buried beneath the dust of the ages. But the bottle endures, its inhabitants still bound. A would-be wielder of the [[Bottle of the Bound]] must know three secret commands: the Word of Opening, to unseal the bottle so the stopper can be removed; the Word of [[Binding]], to call forth and command its denizens; and the Word of [[Banishment]], to return the Bound Ones to the bottle. A holder who knows the words may use the bottle like a summon monster IX spell at will, except only creatures of the evil subtype can be summoned. The summoned creatures remain until the sun next rises or sets, and no new creatures can be summoned from the bottle until the initial summoned creatures' destruction or return. No known force can open the bottle without the Word of Opening. If the bottle is opened without the use of the Word of [[Binding]], its 666 inhabitants are freed, one each minute starting from 1st-level creatures and moving on to higher-level ones, until they all escape. If one of the Bound is called forth and commanded without the Word of [[Banishment]] being uttered, it is free after it performs the task for which it was summoned. The Words to use the [[Bottle of the Bound]] have been lost for uncounted years, although some sages believe they know at least one or two of them.\n",

      "Description: Once the fortress of a legendary tyrant known only as the Storm King, this castle now wanders the known universe, sometimes at the whim of its master, but often as a drifting and aimless haunt of [[power]]ful monsters, ignorant of-or unable to tap into-its fantastic [[power]]. This grand and opulent castle is held aloft and propelled by a foundation of storm clouds constantly rumbling with thunder and crackling with electrical storms. Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 [[Medium]] creatures. Though created by the legendary Storm King millennia ago, the cloud castle has had several masters since he mysteriously disappeared over a thousand years ago. Many believe the Storm King ascended to godhood, while others believe he was captured and imprisoned by a rival, a demon lord, or even a deity wishing to remove a threat, which may mean that the Storm King will one day return to reclaim his castle. In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at least 17th level, and must have the [[Leadership]] feat and 17 ranks in Knowledge (arcana). If the castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can only view places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the [[Fly]] skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a [[Fly]] check and never risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has been known to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this [[power]]. The master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities: • Call lightning storm 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to use this ability. • Guards and wards 1/day on the central tower. • Storm of vengeance 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber to use this ability, and the storm rains down from the castle's cloudy base upon everything within range underneath (2,200 feet). • Wind wall at will. This effect surrounds the entire castle at a range of 100 feet, and can be raised or lowered by the master (or a creature he or she designates) from the control room or any tower as a standard action.\n",

It contains a piece of the demon lord Kostchtchie's mortal soul, entrapped by the [[witch]] Baba Yaga. The torc grants its wearer immunity to cold and the ability to command frost giants at will. This ability functions as dominate person, but affects only frost giants, who take a -10 penalty on their saves. In addition, the wearer can cast giant form II three times per day. Anyone who wears the torc for 1 week also gains the ability to summon an aspect of Kostchtchie once per day. This aspect takes the form of an Abyss gigas (see Appendix 2) who faithfully serves the wearer of the torc for 1 hour. Using the torc in this way certainly alerts Kostchtchie to the torc's whereabouts, and the demon lord will not rest until he has recovered the torc. In addition, any time one of the torc's [[power]]s is used, there is a cumulative 5% chance the wearer goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the [[barbarian]]'s rage ability), attacking the nearest non-giant creature until unconscious or dead or until no living non-giant remains within 30 feet.\n",

It contains a piece of the demon lord Kostchtchie's mortal soul, entrapped by the [[witch]] Baba Yaga. The torc grants its wearer immunity to cold and the ability to command frost giants at will. This ability functions as <i>dominate person</i>, but affects only frost giants, who take a -10 penalty on their saves. In addition, the wearer can cast <i>giant form II</i> three times per day. Anyone who wears the torc for 1 week also gains the ability to summon an aspect of Kostchtchie once per day. This aspect takes the form of an Abyss gigas (see Appendix 2) who faithfully serves the wearer of the torc for 1 hour. Using the torc in this way certainly alerts Kostchtchie to the torc's whereabouts, and the demon lord will not rest until he has recovered the torc. In addition, any time one of the torc's [[power]]s is used, there is a cumulative 5% chance the wearer goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the [[barbarian]]'s rage ability), attacking the nearest non-giant creature until unconscious or dead or until no living non-giant remains within 30 feet.</p></h4></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DESTRUCTION</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h4><p>As Baba Yaga was the one who created the torc, only she possesses the means of destroying it.

      "Description: A ganji doll is the pinnacle of juju sympathetic magic, a fetish tied so intimately to its intended victim that good or ill may be done to the target through the doll itself. During the item's creation, the creator must choose a humanoid creature to bind the doll to. This requires the creator to obtain and craft a bit of the intended target's body-typically hair, blood, or a tooth- into the fetish. Once this has been done, the ganji doll affects no other creature aside from the bound target. The target of the ganji doll cannot be changed after crafting is complete. Once the doll has been created, three times per day, any bearer can employ the doll to create any one of the following effects. These effects only target the creature bound to the doll. The target takes a -2 penalty on all saving throws against these effects. Blind: Covering the doll's head with a cloth blinds the target for 1 minute (DC 16 Will save to resist). Damage: Stabbing the doll with a sharp instrument, waving it over an open flame, wrapping a cord around the doll's neck, or otherwise damaging the doll causes the target to take 3d6 points of damage (DC 16 Fortitude save for half). This damage ignores all resistances and immunities. Target: The ganji doll functions as the bound target itself for the purpose of any spell with a range of touch. The target receives the effect of any spell cast upon the doll (up to the doll's limit of 3 effects per day) as if the caster had actually touched him. The target may make saving throws against such spells, if allowed, as normal, but takes the -2 penalty imposed by the doll. Beneficial spells, such as cure light wounds, can also be used in this manner.\n",

      "Description: The original Book of the [[Damned]] was collected from the scattered records of the exiled angel Tabris, who was ordered to record the lore of all the multiverse but was cast out of Heaven for his findings. The demonic chapters of the Book of the [[Damned]] are bound between razor-edged covers of cold iron. Care must be taken when opening this book, lest the covers cut the fingers. Blood spattered on the pages of the book quickly fades away, as if the damp sheets of pale parchment within possessed a thirsty, vampiric nature. A DC 12 Reflex save is enough to avoid being cut when opening this book-on a failed save, the user takes 2 points of Constitution damage. This section of the Book of the [[Damned]] serves as a catalogue of the Abyssal realms and their lords-yet just as the rulers of the Abyss wax and wane, the contents of this book shift and change as well, revealing dark secrets. Any good-aligned creature who touches this section of the Book of the [[Damned]] gains one negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from the book for 24 hours. Creatures attempting to read the book that are not chaotic evil must make a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step toward chaotic evil. These pages of the Book of the [[Damned]] are written in Abyssal. A reader who spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) reading the book receives several benefits. The book contains copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as all of the arcane spells listed below. The user gains a +4 bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks if she uses the book as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of the Abyss are so accurate that any teleportation travel to or within the Abyss always brings the caster to the exact location desired. The demonic section of the Book of the [[Damned]] serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy tuned to attract chaotic evil creatures. As long as the book is carried, its owner casts all evil spells as if she were 2 caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with chaotic evil creatures. Three times per day, the tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, desecrate, greater planar binding, insanity, rift of ruin (see page 48), summon monster VII, or unholy blight. Once per day as a standard action, the bearer can use the book to gain any one of the boons granted by any demon lord-the boon lasts as long as the owner retains possession of the book, or until she chooses a new boon. This does not require an obedience.\n",

      "Description: The celestial lens is a 12-foot-diameter lens mounted in a rune-covered circular frame of strange, alien metal, floating in a permanent orbit around the Sun Temple. Several smaller lenses of similar design hover around the primary lens like a bizarre orrery, moving into place to [[focus]] the arcane rays of the device. The ancient Azlanti created the celestial lens to capture the light of sacred eclipses and solar conjunctions, as well as the refracted darkness found between stars. Celestial rays can be directed in an extremely [[power]]ful beam of energy that manifests as a vertical column of searing energy blasts [[focus]]ed directly below the celestial lens. Depending on the will of the controller and GM adjudication for inclement weather, such blasts deal between 5d6 and 20d6 points of damage in a 5-foot-radius cylinder extending from the lens to the ground or target. During the day, half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine [[power]] and is therefore not reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. At night, the device [[focus]]es distant starlight, and the maximum damage is only 10d6, although the lens does not function at all for 1 hour before sunrise and 1 hour after sunset. The lens moves with a constant speed of 20 feet and damages everything caught in the affected areas each round. Victims may make a DC 25 Reflex save for half damage. The lens orbits at a static height of 100 feet from the ground and moves at a speed of 20 feet per round. It cannot be stopped or accelerated, although the path of the transit can be altered by a user in possession of the flame of guidance. When not directed, the lens maintains its last commanded path, eventually curving into a new elliptical orbit around the sun temple, scorching a path through whatever lies below. The user can alter both the damage (up to the maximum for the current lighting conditions) and the orbit in any direction, but the lens must move 20 feet each round, and cannot travel more than 3 miles from the temple in any direction before it curves back around and begins returning.\n",

      "Description: A strange statue of some unknown dark material resembling unnaturally slippery stone, this idol is carved in the shape of something at once unrecognizable and terrifyingly organic, and possesses a number of [[unique]] abilities when touching liquid. Geyser: If four or more levels' worth of spells are cast upon the Aqualinth, the artifact is capable of causing the water surrounding it to purify and multiply, generating thousands of gallons of water. At the same time, it creates an effect mimicking reverse gravity upon the water, causing it to shoot up in a geyser capable of reaching a thousand feet high. Moments later, the effect passes; the water comes crashing down, and can be captured or diverted in the process, though the water level of the original supply remains unchanged. Bath of the God-Kings: Bathing in a pool infested by the Aqualinth instantly refreshes the bather, removing any fatigued or exhausted conditions. In addition, the bather is treated as though he were wearing a ring of sustenance for the next 4 months. Regular bathing for 56 days results in a +1 increase to a single ability score of the bather's choice-a creature can receive this bonus only once, but can continue to receive the other benefits of bathing in the pool. Liquid Ones: Anyone who spies her own reflection in a pool infested by the Aqualinth and who is not completely loyal to the Four Pharaohs of Ascension is treated as though she had gazed into the reflective surface of a mirror of opposition. The duplicates created by the Aqualinth are not truly identical to their originals. A duplicate has vulnerability to fire, losing any fire resistance or immunity the original may have, and also gains the water subtype. A duplicate can be distinguished from the original with a DC 30 Perception check, as the duplicate has a faint watery texture to its skin. Whispering Water: Possessed of a malign and alien intellect, the Aqualinth has an unknown agenda of its own, and is capable of casting suggestion (save DC 31) upon anyone who drinks at least half a gallon of water it has touched or produced.\n",

      "Description: This huge, ornate throne, carved from white marble and inlaid with flickering, smoking, multicolored spirals of serpentstone, is uncomfortably tall and thin for most humans, as it is designed to seat a high priest of the serpentfolk. While seated upon the throne, a divine caster who worships Ydersius may use a spell slot or exchange any prepared divine spell (including domain spells) of 3rd level or higher to cast dispel magic. Once per day, a divine caster of sufficient level may instead cast greater dispel magic in place of a spell of 6th level or higher. This ability is in most other ways identical to the spontaneous casting of [[cleric]]s and [[druid]]s (see the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook), but may also be employed by [[anti[[paladin]]]]s, [[inquisitor]]s, [[oracle]]s, or other divine casters faithful to Ydersius. The throne bestows one permanent negative level on any creature that sits upon it, other than divine casters who worship Ydersius. This negative level remains as long as the non-sentient or heretical creature sits upon the throne and disappears when the throne is vacated. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells) while the throne is occupied.\n",

      "Description: The skull of Ydersius is far more than just a [[power]]ful artifact-it is the actual skull of a god. The skull itself is all but indestructible, and while it can observe the [[world]] around it, its capacity to interact with that [[world]] is limited. Ydersius's [[cleric]]s still receive spells from their prayers, granted by this very skull regardless of its location or who might claim the skull as their own-there is no way a mortal can block this effect. Relatively bulky, the skull itself measures nearly 5 feet long. The skull's greatest [[power]] is that it contains a god, and if reunited with the god's missing body, it can restore Ydersius to full potency as a deity. Beyond this staggering [[power]], though, possession of the skull of Ydersius grants several [[power]]ful abilities, as outlined below. • The skull treats the 80-foot-radius area around it as though an unhallow spell had been cast with the skull as the touched point of origin. This effect carries with it two linked spells that affect only worshipers of Ydersius (death ward and freedom of movement), and two linked spells that affect all non-worshipers of Ydersius (dimensional anchor and bane). • Once per day, a creature that touches the skull may cast commune to speak with Ydersius. A non-worshiper of Ydersius who uses this [[power]] must make a DC 25 Will save each time the [[power]] is used to avoid succumbing to a feeblemind spell. • All reptilian creatures (including all worshipers of Ydersius, [[sorcerer]]s with the serpentine or draconic bloodline, and [[druid]]s currently wildshaped into reptilian forms) within 160 feet of the skull of Ydersius gain spell resistance 25 and fast healing 10. Any good-aligned creature that carries the skull of Ydersius, even via an extradimensional space such as a portable hole, gains three negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the skull is carried and disappear when the skull is released. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the skull is carried. A creature that suffers from these negative levels has a 50% spell failure chance on all divine spellcasting attempts.\n",

      "Description: A totem of Angazhan is a dangerous and sinister artifact created by the demon lord Angazhan-originally, only one such totem existed, but as the reach of the Gorilla King expanded, additional totems began to appear in various hidden parts of the Mwangi Expanse, especially to the south of the Screaming Jungle in the deep, unexplored center of Garund. Each totem of Angazhan possesses a crude intelligence and can observe the [[world]] around it via true seeing. It can also hear and possesses tremorsense. All three of these senses extend to a range of 30 feet; the totem cannot detect anything beyond this range. A totem of Angazhan constantly radiates an aura of fear that fills the minds of any creatures within 30 feet with cruel memories of past lives in which they were consumed alive by apes-whether or not these past deaths are accurate is irrelevant to the sensation of horror they invoke in victims. All non-worshipers of Angazhan within this area must make a DC 15 Will save each round to avoid becoming panicked for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. Once per round, a totem of Angazhan can cast weird. This is its primary means of defense, and it can target all creatures within 30 feet that it can sense. The effect manifests at caster level 20th, and has a save DC of 23. Once per day, a totem of Angazhan can reincarnate a single creature that dies within 30 feet of it. Unlike the spell of the same name, the reincarnated creature always returns to life as a Chaotic Evil charau-ka. A creature reincarnated as a charau-ka gains +4 Str, +2 Dex, and +4 Con. Once per year, the totem may instead use its reincarnate ability to bring a creature back to life as a Chaotic Evil dire ape-it is this ability that creates the creatures that go on to become Gorilla Kings. A creature reincarnated as a dire ape gains +8 Str, +4 Dex, and +6 Con. When a new dire ape champion is created, it becomes infused with a desire to seek out the current Gorilla King and challenge him to a fight to the death-the survivor continues ruling as the Gorilla King for another year. In this fashion, the Mwangi Expanse has never gone for more than several months without a Gorilla King for the past several hundred years. As with all reincarnate effects, the creature being restored to life must be willing for the effect to work-the creature to be reincarnated knows that accepting the offer to come back to life enslaves its soul to Angazhan (resulting in the shift to Chaotic Evil and the drive to seek out and replace the current Gorilla King). If a totem of Angazhan is placed upon or adjacent to an altar of Angazhan that is under the effect of an unhallow spell cast by a worshiper of Angazhan, the totem of Angazhan's sensory range extends to 300 feet, and it can use its abilities in this extended range as long as it has line of sight to its target.\n",

It can also hear and possesses tremorsense. All three of these senses extend to a range of 30 feet; the totem cannot detect anything beyond this range. A <i><i>totem of</i> Angazhan</i> constantly radiates an aura of fear that fills the minds of any creatures within 30 feet with cruel memories of past lives in which they were consumed alive by apes-whether or not these past deaths are accurate is irrelevant to the sensation of horror they invoke in victims. All non-worshipers of Angazhan within this area must make a DC 15 Will save each round to avoid becoming panicked for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.</p><p>Once per round, a <i><i>totem of</i> Angazhan</i> can cast <i>weird</i>. This is its primary means of defense, and it can target all creatures within 30 feet that it can sense. The effect manifests at caster level 20th, and has a save DC of 23.</p><p>Once per day, a <i><i>totem of</i> Angazhan</i> can <i>reincarnate</i> a single creature that dies within 30 feet of it. Unlike the spell of the same name, the <i>reincarnate</i>d creature always returns to life as a Chaotic Evil charau-ka. A creature <i>reincarnate</i>d as a charau-ka gains +4 Str, +2 Dex, and +4 Con.</p><p>Once per year, the totem may instead use its <i>reincarnate</i> ability to bring a creature back to life as a Chaotic Evil dire ape-it is this ability that creates the creatures that go on to become Gorilla Kings. A creature <i>reincarnate</i>d as a dire ape gains +8 Str, +4 Dex, and +6 Con.</p><p>When a new dire ape champion is created, it becomes infused with a desire to seek out the current Gorilla King and challenge him to a fight to the death-the survivor continues ruling as the Gorilla King for another year.

Of course, once a Gorilla King makes his first attack upon one of these totems, the blasphemy against Angazhan causes that Gorilla King to no longer count as a worshiper of Angazhan, and he can now be affected by the totem's fear aura. Worse, the affront allows the <i><i>totem of</i> Angazhan</i> to attempt once per round to revoke that Gorilla King's <i>reincarnate</i>d body.

Within the vial roils a small wisp of white vapor, churning as if caught in a miniature vortex of air. To capture a haunt's energies within a haunt siphon, you need only twist the metal casing to open the vial in the same round that the haunt manifests (a standard action)-this can be before or after the haunt has acted. You must be within the haunt's area of influence to use a haunt siphon. When you activate a haunt siphon, it deals 3d6 points of positive energy damage to a single haunt. If it deals enough damage to the haunt to reduce the haunt's hit points to 0, the mist inside the haunt siphon glows green-if it does not reduce the haunt to 0 hit points, the haunt siphon is still expended and becomes nonmagical. It may take multiple haunt siphons to destroy [[power]]ful haunts. A haunt that is neutralized by a haunt siphon takes a -5 penalty on its caster level check to manifest again after its reset time passes. A haunt siphon that neutralizes a haunt can no longer be used to harm haunts, but it can be used as a grenadelike splash weapon that deals 1d6 points of negative energy damage with a direct hit.

      "Description: A spirit planchette is typically found in a wooden case along with a thin wooden board printed with numerous letters and numbers. Nonmagical versions of these divination tools can be purchased in curiosity shops (typically costing 25 gp); while these items can be used as alternative components for augury spells, only magical spirit planchettes allow users to communicate with the other side. Three types of spirit planchettes exist-brass, cold iron, and silver. Each in turn allows an increasingly potent form of divination effect to be utilized. A spirit planchette requires a board to move upon, but this \"board\" can be made up of letters scribed upon any smooth surface-it need not be a prepared board for a spirit planchette to work. To use a spirit planchette, you must rest your fingers lightly upon the planchette's surface and then concentrate on the planchette (as if maintaining a spell with a duration of concentration) for 2d6 rounds while the planchette attunes itself to the ambient [[spirits]] of the area. After this time, the planchette begins to slowly slide in random patterns across the board-at this point, questions may be asked of the [[spirits]] by any of the individuals involved in the seance. The consequences of each question asked of the [[spirits]] depends upon what type of planchette is used for the divination, as summarized on the table below. The [[spirits]] reply in a language understood by the character who asked the question, but resent such contact and give only brief answers to the questions. All questions are answered with \"yes,\" \"no,\" or \"maybe,\" or by spelling out a single word from the letters arranged on the board. The [[spirits]] answer each question either in the same round the question is asked (in the case of a yes, no, or maybe answer) or at a rate of one letter per round (in the case of a single word being spelled out). A spirit planchette may be used once per day-the maximum number of questions you can ask with it depends on the type of planchette being used (as detailed on the table below). Communication with [[spirits]] can be a dangerous task, for many [[spirits]] are jealous or hateful of the living. Every time a spirit planchette is used, the user must succeed on a Will save to avoid being temporarily possessed and harmed by the angry [[spirits]]. In some areas where the [[spirits]] are particularly violent or hateful (such as in Harrowstone), this Will save takes a -2 penalty. The DC of this save depends on the type of spirit planchette being used. Anyone who fails the Will save becomes confused for a number of rounds (depending on the type of planchette being used), and no answer is received. The [[spirits]] in the area are not omniscient-the GM should decide whether or not the [[spirits]] would actually know the answer to the question asked, and if they do not, the answer granted is automatically \"maybe.\" If the GM determines that the [[spirits]] are knowledgeable about the answer, roll d% to determine whether the [[spirits]] speak truthfully or whether they lie.

      "Description: This pendant holds a glowing crystal etched with faint runes. Created by the pactmasters of [[Katapesh]] to manipulate and control their constructs known as aluums, these charms are much sought after on the black market. Unauthorized possession of a charm of aluum control is considered a grave crime in [[Katapesh]], punishable by decades of imprisonment, exile, or even death. Each charm of aluum control is attuned to a single, specific aluum, but the magic of the charm allows it to function somewhat against other aluums as well. Against its specific attuned aluum, the charm grants you the ability to command that construct as if you were using dominate person on a humanoid creature. This effect functions against other aluums, but non-attuned aluums gain a DC 16 Will save to resist the effect. If an aluum fails such a save, it becomes attuned to that charm and the previous aluum becomes unattuned-a single charm of aluum control can only be attuned to one aluum at a time. For purposes of this effect, ordering an aluum to attack a Pactmaster or someone who appears to be part of [[Katapesh]]'s government or army or to damage any structure in the city of [[Katapesh]] counts as an action against the aluum's nature and allows the aluum a new saving throw with a +2 bonus to resist the charm's effects. If an aluum escapes this effect, it is no longer attuned and typically attacks the target who attempted to command it.\n",

A goz mask allows you to see through fog, smoke, and other obscuring vapors as if they did not exist (this ability functions underwater as well, allowing the wearer to see through thick silt and other aquatic precipitates). Additionally, you are treated as one size category larger than you are and gain a +4 bonus on all saving throws made to resist the effects of wind while wearing a goz mask.

      "Description: During the battle between the Whispering Tyrant and General Arnisant, the lich unleashed terrible magic upon the outnumbered mortal army. Despite the lich's [[power]], Arnisant was protected from the onslaught by his magical shield, an artifact known as the [[[[Shield]] of Aroden]]. When the two finally faced off, the Whispering Tyrant attempted to use a wish to summon Arnisant's heart to his waiting claws. The [[[[Shield]] of Aroden]] prevented this dire fate and instead shattered into a dozen fragments, one of which appeared in Tar-Baphon's hand, fusing with the undead flesh and burning the lich with holy fire. When the flames subsided, the crippled lich was soon locked away in the dungeons beneath Gallowspire, there to rot for all eternity. The [[[[Shield]] of Aroden]] lost all of its [[power]]. Its broken remnants have been passed down from one watcher-lord to another without fail. Some say that should the Whispering Tyrant ever become free, the missing piece of the shield would have to be recovered from his bony claw for the fiend to truly be defeated. This item is normally kept on display in the city of Vigil in [[Lastwall]], though at first glance it is just a collection of wooden shards on a large black silk pillow. If assembled, these 12 shards would form a round shield with a piece in the center missing. The shield's face is carved to look like Aroden's holy symbol-a winged eye in a circle. Originally known as the [[[[Shield]] of Aroden]], most today call it by its new name-the [[Shatter]]ed [[Shield]] of Arnisant. If restored to its former glory (a task that could in and of itself be a campaign), the [[Shatter]]ed [[Shield]] becomes the [[[[Shield]] of Aroden]] once again-a +5 light fortification spell resistance (17) heavy wooden shield. Once per day, you can invoke a form of fire shield that protects against cold attacks and damages opponents with fire and holy damage like a flame strike (it is likely that this ability is what burned the lich in his final battle). Once per round as an immediate action, if an adjacent ally is hit by a ranged or melee attack, you can use the shield to redirect the attack to yourself, suffering all effects from that attack as if you were its intended target. All allies within 100 feet of you gain the effect of bless and prayer. As with a status spell, all allies within 100 feet know your relative position and condition. The [[[[Shield]] of Aroden]] bestows two negative levels on any chaotic creature that attempts to wield it. The negative levels remain as long as the shield is held or carried. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the creature holds or carries the shield.\n",

      "Description: [[Thuvia]]'s sun orchid elixir is a nearly perfect solution for those who seek eternal life. A single dose of sun orchid elixir cannot stop the aging process, but it does the next-best thing-it restores youth. A creature that drinks the elixir is restored to its starting age as a young adult. The drinker's new age is randomly determined using Table 7-1 on page 169 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook. All penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution the drinker may have suffered as a result of advanced age are removed, but all bonuses to Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma that result from advanced age remain (although as the character ages again into middle age and beyond, he does not gain any of these bonuses a second time). Vanity-seekers go to nearly any length to acquire the elixir, resorting to bribery, extortion, and murder. To curtail such troubles in the land of its creation, the use of the elixir is outlawed in [[Thuvia]] (except by the formula's creator). Each vial of sun orchid elixir requires six mature sun orchids and 1 month's time to ferment, although the exact formula used is a secret known only to the denizen of [[Alchemist]]'s Keep in [[Thuvia]]. Prices for a dose of the elixir vary wildly since the elixir is sold at auction, but no dose has ever sold for less than 50,000 gp.\n",

      "Description: When the [[Worldwound]] destroyed the nation of Sarkoris, the faithful of [[Iomedae]] seized upon the event as a balm against the horror of Aroden's death. The invention of the first wardstones, giant menhirs infused with holy magic meant to contain and repel demonic creatures, was perhaps the greatest result of the crusader's initial response to Sarkoris's destruction. Today, dozens of wardstones stand sentinel along the borders of the [[Worldwound]]. The primary purpose of the wardstones is to contain the growing influence of the [[Worldwound]] itself, but they also exude a [[power]]ful field similar to that generated by a forbiddance spell. A single wardstone exerts this aura in a 300-foot radius, but when multiple wardstones are linked (as in the case of those running along the border of the [[Worldwound]]), they create a 300-footwide path of forbiddance, with the wardstones running down the middle. The forbiddance area, be it a radius or path, deals 12d6 points of damage per round to any demon within that area (DC 18 Will save half; spell resistance applies). [[Teleport]]ation effects do not function in this zone at all. The wardstones that bolster the eastern and southern borders of the [[Worldwound]] have a further effect as well-[[focus]]ed on the [[Worldwound]] as they are, they prevent demons from teleporting into or out of the [[Worldwound]] and effectively contain the threat. The arrangement of the wardstones along the [[Mendev]], [[Numeria]], and [[Ustalav]] borders is such that even the unwarded borders to the west and north work to hamper demonic incursions.\n",

      "Description: Death cults such as the Whispering Way use this elixir to prevent their enemies from stealing their members' secrets, even after death. Elite cultists typically imbibe deathgag elixir as part of an elaborate initiation ritual when they are promoted to high-ranking positions in the cult. Thereafter, should the imbiber fall below -1 hit point, the elixir triggers the release of a fatal poison that throws him into wild convulsions. The victim begins foaming at the mouth, and his eyes turn blood red. Soon after, the victim's entire jaw dissolves, rendering him immune to speak with dead spells. Prior to the victim's death, only a limited wish, miracle, or wish spell can undo the effects of the elixir. Individuals that have imbibed deathgag elixir are noted as being \"deathgagged\" in the Defensive Abilities section of their stat blocks.\n",

Elite cultists typically imbibe <i>deathgag elixir</i> as part of an elaborate initiation ritual when they are promoted to high-ranking positions in the cult. Thereafter, should the imbiber fall below -1 hit point, the elixir triggers the release of a fatal poison that throws him into wild convulsions. The victim begins foaming at the mouth, and his eyes turn blood red. Soon after, the victim's entire jaw dissolves, rendering him immune to <i>speak with dead</i> spells. Prior to the victim's death, only a <i>limited <i>wish</i></i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell can undo the effects of the elixir.

      "Description: Most bags of devouring appear as normal sacks, but [[Chomper]] is unlike most bags of devouring. Sporting rows of vicious teeth, a bad attitude, and a thirst to devour all things, this intelligent cursed item believes it is the favored maw and most important appendage of a creature it refers to as the Eater of All. [[Chomper]] hates all creatures except for demons, whom it considers kindred [[spirits]] of destruction. [[Chomper]] has all of the magical abilities of a regular bag of devouring (Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook 539), along with the following additional [[power]]s. Bite: As a standard action, [[Chomper]]'s possessor can swing the bag by its straps in an attempt to strike any target within a 5-foot radius. The possessor targets a single creature or unattended item with this attack. [[Chomper]] (not the wielder) makes a single bite attack against the creature or item targeted: bite +14 (1d10+5 and bleed 2). This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity, despite the quasit's Tiny size. Attacks made in this way are never modified by the wielder's abilities-Azrikalis cannot modify his attack roll with his Dexterity modifier, for example, nor can he use [[Chomper]] to make sneak attacks. Hateful Curse: When a non-demon is in possession of [[Chomper]], the bag's cursed aura imparts a -1 penalty on all of its wielder's attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If [[Chomper]] manages to seize control of a non-demon host through personality conflict, it directs its host to seek out victims to feed to it.\n",

      "Description: Short lengths of twine dangle sharp metal needles from each end of this cross-shaped wooden bar. To use a marionette crux, the wielder points the item at any humanoid within 25 feet and makes a ranged touch attack as a standard action as the strings suddenly extend out. If the attack hits, the needles pierce the victim's wrists and ankles, causing the victim to become sickened for 1 round by the momentary flash of pain. In addition, the victim must make a DC 17 Will save to avoid being dominated by the crux, as if via dominate person. The needles immediately retract back to the crux an instant after they strike a foe, but if the victim has been dominated, the crux's wielder can control its actions. Control lies with the crux, not the person who made the initial attack-passing the crux to another creature allows that creature to take control of the dominated humanoid. If the crux is given to the victim, the effect ends. The crux must be held in the user's hand in order for the user to issue a new command to the victim. Otherwise, the domination effect caused by a marionette crux lasts for a day, but additional uses of the crux can effectively extend the effect over a victim indefinitely. A marionette crux can maintain domination over only one creature at a time-if a second humanoid is dominated by the crux, the previously dominated human is released from the effect immediately. A marionette crux can be activated up to two times per day.\n",

      "Description: Metamagic gems can be used to enhance spells with various metamagic effects, similar to the way metamagic rods are used, save that metamagic gems are consumed when they are used. To apply the effects of a metamagic gem to a spell, you need only use the metamagic gem as an additional material component for the spell in question. When you apply a metamagic effect to a spell using a metamagic gem, the spell slot of the altered spell does not change. You may only use one metamagic gem on any given spell, and while that spell cannot be further enhanced by a metamagic rod, it can be used with spells already enhanced in the normal way via any metamagic feats you possess. In this case, only the feats possessed by you adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast. Use of a metamagic gem does not confer the associated feat on the owner, only the one-time ability to use the given feat. A [[sorcerer]] or other spontaneous spellcaster must still take a fullround action when using a metamagic gem, just as if using a metamagic feat he possesses (except for quickening diamonds, which can be used as a swift action). The metamagic gems presented here are not the only such gems that exist. Other metamagic gems based on metamagic feats from other sources could easily be created-their costs should follow the pattern presented here (1,000 gp for gems that alter a spell slot by 1 level, 2,000 gp for those that alter spell slots by 2 levels, and so on), and each new gem should have a corresponding [[unique]] gemstone type associated with it.\n",

      "Description: A brain cylinder allows the surgically extracted brain of a Large or smaller creature to continue to function even after it has been removed from the body. Technically, the creature from whom the brain was harvested is dead, but as long as the brain remains in the cylinder, the creature can continue to think. Dials on the cylinder's side control whether the brain can see, hear, or speak using a raspy speaker built into the cylinder's surface. The brain can speak and understand any languages it knew in life, and retains the use of the following skills at the values it possessed while alive: Appraise, Bluff, Diplomacy, all Knowledge skills, Linguistics, Perception, and Sense Motive. It retains no other abilities it possessed in life, including purely mental abilities. The mi-go typically preserve humanoid brains in this grisly manner when they wish to interrogate a creature at a later date, or when they wish to preserve a creature as a resource for consultation or research purposes. A brain cylinder is usually made of dark metal and has hardness 10 and 30 hit points-cylinders made of other materials might have higher or lower hardness scores and hit point totals. If a brain cylinder is destroyed, the brain within is lost. Likewise, if the creature from whom the brain was harvested is restored to life, the brain within the cylinder is destroyed, and only [[power]]ful effects capable of building entirely new bodies can restore to life a creature that has had its brain removed. Note that the gp price to create a brain cylinder only accounts for the basic creation-the brain of a particularly knowledgeable creature could be worth far more than 5,000 gp to some buyers, especially if the information contained in the brain is of a particularly sensitive nature.\n",

In that time, the weapon has gone somewhat insane, warped to thirst for the death of non-duergar dwarves and eager to please the line of duergar rulers of Tar Vermilon.

This ability can be used three times a day. In addition, the bracers may be removed and tossed into the air as a standard action, where they transform into a pair of identical black metallic ravens similar to silver raven figurines of wondrous [[power]]. Like those items, these ravens obey the wearer, and may each bear a message as if affected by the animal messenger spell. The ravens can only take this shape once per week, retaining the form continuously for up to 24 hours. Once both of these ravens have delivered their messages (or once the 24-hour limit is reached), they both vanish in a cloud of smoke and return unerringly to the owner's hands via teleportation.

These Amatatsu scions often experience a series of visions of the past, present, and possible future. The [[Amatatsu Seal]] has a daily allotment of 5 charges that it can use to cast the following spells on an Amatatsu scion: cure serious wounds, remove curse, remove disease, or restoration. Each casting uses up 1 daily charge. Alternatively, the seal can cast heal on an Amatatsu scion, but doing so expends all 5 charges.

A DC 20 Perception check (an automatic success once repair is underway) reveals a secret compartment in the hilt just large enough to hold a small item such as a flask or rolled piece of paper.

Within the Society, legends hold that many of these masks are actually [[power]]ful magical items called Decemvirate helms, [[sai]]d to have been discovered by Durvin Gest on his first expedition to the ruined continent of Azlant. According to these stories, the helms not only mask the wearers' faces, but also function as helms of telepathy combined with amulets of proof against detection and location. The wearer of a Decemvirate helm can use disguise self at will and benefits from discern lies and true seeing at all times. The helm provides 100% protection from all gaze attacks and all forms of magical control. Specific Decemvirate helms may have additional [[power]]s as well- certainly, all are [[sai]]d to be [[unique]] in physical appearance. Of course, beyond these few details that most Pathfinders hold as fact, little is known about the helms, and they remain some of the Pathfinder Society's greatest and most secret treasures-if one were to fall into the possession of anyone other than a Decemvirate member, the Society would undoubtedly spare no expense in retrieving the item. Some stories tell of non-Decemvirate Pathfinders being temporarily granted the use of the items or \"borrowing\" them, but such reports are likely little more than groundless boasts.\n",

Once per day, a single command causes this block of wood to unfold in the space of 1 round into an exquisite writing desk sized for a Small or [[Medium]] author, complete with four vials of ink, two writing quills, and 50 blank sheets of paper. The desk creates new supplies of ink, quills, and paper each time it is unfolded. Once the desk is unfolded, it creates a 20-footradius hemisphere centered on the desk's location-this effect is identical to that created by a tiny hut spell. Once activated, the desk's tiny hut effect lasts for up to 10 hours or until the desk is folded up or moved more than a few inches. Of course, the effect also works to provide an ideal spot for a campsite, and in most parties a field scrivener's desk is used solely for this effect.\n",

Once per day, a spontaneous caster can draw upon a runestone of [[power]] to cast a spell-doing so is part of the spellcasting action, and expends that runestone's [[power]] for the day rather than one of the spellcaster's actual spell slots for the day. An expended runestone of [[power]] recharges its capacity after 24 hours. The spell must be of a particular level, depending on the runestone.\n",

Although Suishen is neutral good, any Amatatsu scion, regardless of alignment, can wield the sword without gaining a negative level. This boon is at Suishen's discretion, however, and should such a scion ever betray the family or prove unworthy as an heir, the sword can reinstate this penalty and cause a personality conflict. Even though Suishen can likely dominate anyone who tries to wield it, the sword usually acquiesces to the wishes of its wielder, provided she is a rightful Amatatsu scion-though after 50 years of holding its silence, Suishen is a bit rough as a conversationalist, communicating in a very gruff, no-nonsense manner.

      "Description: This tattered white canvas banner looks like an old piece of [[sai]]lcloth, or perhaps a winding shroud-a 4-foot-by-6-foot rectangle with loops that can fit over a spear haft or pole running up one side. If mounted on a longspear or pole at least 8 feet in length, the banner shifts in appearance to match the heraldry or coat of arms of the person who attached it. If that person has no device, the flag instead displays a device that echoes the owner's personality (such as a favorite animal, favored weapon, or holy symbol of the wielder's deity). When carried into battle, a banner of the ancient kings confers several benefits. As long as the longspear or pole to which the banner is attached is firmly wielded in two hands, its carrier gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Initiative checks. In addition, when so wielded, it grants the wielder and all allies within 30 feet a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If the carrier of the banner fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, he may attempt a new saving throw against that effect every round he continues to wield the banner of the ancient kings- once he releases his firm grip on the banner's haft, though, he no longer gets this benefit, even if he wields the banner properly at a later point while still under the effects of the mind-affecting effect. If the banner's carrier possesses the [[Flagbearer]] feat (Pathfinder Campaign Setting: The Inner Sea World Guide 286), the banner of the ancient kings doubles the morale bonuses granted by that feat. A [[bard]] who carries a longspear or pole to which a banner of the ancient kings has been attached is treated as four levels higher than his actual [[bard]] level for the purposes of determining the bonuses granted by his inspire courage [[bard]]ic performance ability.\n",

If mounted on a longspear or pole at least 8 feet in length, the banner shifts in appearance to match the heraldry or coat of arms of the person who attached it. If that person has no device, the flag instead displays a device that echoes the owner's personality (such as a favorite animal, favored weapon, or holy symbol of the wielder's deity). When carried into battle, a <i>banner of the ancient kings</i> confers several benefits. As long as the longspear or pole to which the banner is attached is firmly wielded in two hands, its carrier gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Initiative checks. In addition, when so wielded, it grants the wielder and all allies within 30 feet a +2 <i>resistance</i> bonus on all saving throws against mind-affecting effects. If the carrier of the banner fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, he may attempt a new saving throw against that effect every round he continues to wield the <i>banner of the ancient kings</i>- once he releases his firm grip on the banner's haft, though, he no longer gets this benefit, even if he wields the banner properly at a later point while still under the effects of the mind-affecting effect. If the banner's carrier possesses the [[Flagbearer]] feat (<i>Pathfinder Campaign Setting</i>: <i>The Inner Sea World Guide</i> 286), the <i>banner of the ancient kings</i> doubles the morale bonuses granted by that feat. A [[bard]] who carries a longspear or pole to which a <i>banner of the ancient kings</i> has been attached is treated as four levels higher than his actual [[bard]] level for the purposes of determining the bonuses granted by his inspire courage [[bard]]ic performance ability.</p></h4></div><hr/><div><h5><b>CONSTRUCTION</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Requirements </b>[[Craft Wondrous Item]], <i>heroism</i>, <i>resistance</i>; <b>Cost </b>9,000 gp</h5></div>\n",

      "Description: This small harp is carved from whale ivory, and its frame is filigreed with delicate gold patterns depicting winds and clouds. Up to three times per day as a standard action, you can use a harp of storms to surround yourself with an aura of brisk wind that grants you a 20% miss chance against all ranged attacks. This wind cloak effect lasts for 1 minute. At any time during that minute, you may strike additional notes on the harp of storms in order to produce one of the following three effects. • [[Air Walk]]: You cause the winds to lift you off the ground, granting you the effects of an air walk spell for 1 round. This is normally a move action, but if you succeed at a DC 15 Perform (strings) check, it is a swift action. • [[Gust of Wind]]: You can direct the winds surrounding you to duplicate the effects of a gust of wind spell. This is a standard action. • [[Light]]ning Strike: As a standard action, make a Perform (strings) check. You cause a bolt of lightning to strike a single foe within 30 feet, dealing an amount of electricity damage equal to the result of your Perform (strings) check. The target gets a DC 15 Reflex save to halve the damage caused by this lightning strike.\n",

      "Description: A sashimono of comfort is a purple Tian silk banner, typically 3 feet tall and 1 foot wide, decorated with three stylized orchid flowers. The banner is attached to a lance, polearm, staff, or frame, which can be worn on the back of a creature, carried by a mounted creature, flown from a wagon, or planted in the ground. A sashimono of comfort keeps creatures comfortable in extreme weather conditions. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground. When worn or carried by a creature, the banner grants the effects of endure elements to the bearer. When carried by a mounted creature, it grants both mount and rider this benefit. If it is flown from a wagon, the wagon's driver, passengers, and draft team all gain this benefit. If planted firmly in the ground, the banner grants this benefit to all creatures within 30 feet. In addition, a caravan equipped with a sashimono of comfort gains a +2 bonus on Security checks to resist the effects of severe weather. These effects function at temperatures between -50° and 140° F. If conditions are beyond these extremes, creatures using a sashimono of comfort treat the ambient temperature as if it were 50° F warmer or cooler respectively, thereby possibly allowing additional castings of endure elements to work normally.\n",

      "Description: The original Book of the [[Damned]] was collected from the scattered records of the exiled angel Tabris, who was ordered to record the lore of all the multiverse but was cast out of Heaven for his findings. The daemonic chapters of the Book of the [[Damned]] are bound between covers of perpetually frozen and compressed ashes that seem to suck away ambient light into their material. All known copies of the text appear to be some variety of palimpsest, with the words written over the intentionally erased words of an earlier draft, though it is unknown when and by whom this redaction took place. In each case, the edited portions describe specific names relating to the earliest history of the plane, sometimes with entire pages being censored. [[Scholar]]s suspect this is related to the same magic utilized by the Horsemen to scour their own records and history in cycles when one of the Four has been replaced. Any good-aligned creature who touches this section of the Book of the [[Damned]] gains one negative level. This level cannot be restored until the character has remained more than 10 feet away from the book for 24 hours. Creatures attempting to read the book that are not neutral evil must make a DC 15 Will save or have their alignment permanently take one step toward neutral evil. Written in a mixture of Abyssal and Infernal, sometimes changing from one to the other mid-sentence, the text requires true fluency in both languages to fully understand the nuances and true meaning of the text. As a reader proceeds, he becomes aware of a dull pressure on the back of his skull and a buzzing static. Eventually the text begins to \"speak\" to him, inserting telepathic impressions and images to complement the text. A telepathic creature may \"read\" the text without actually opening the book merely by holding it and concentrating. A reader who splashes his own blood onto the book (which is promptly absorbed) and spends 30 days (not necessarily consecutively) reading the book receives several benefits. The book contains copies of every spell with the evil descriptor, as well as all of the spells on pages 38-39 and those listed below. The user gains at +4 bonus on all Knowledge (planes) checks when using the book as a resource (consulting it for at least an hour regarding a question), and its descriptions of Abaddon are so accurate that any teleportation to or within that plane always brings the caster to the desired location (no familiarity roll needed). Any energy-draining spell cast by the bearer bestows +1 additional negative level on affected creatures. The daemonic portion of the Book of the [[Damned]] serves as the focal point for a permanent unhallow effect and sympathy attuned to attract neutral evil creatures. As long as the book is carried, its owner casts all evil spells as if he were two caster levels higher and gains a +2 bonus on all Charisma-based skills and checks when interacting with neutral evil creatures. Four times per day, the tome can be used to cast one of the following spells: blasphemy, circle of death, energy drain, death knell, soul bind, or soul transfer (see page 39). It is believed that the bearer can be scried at any time, without a saving throw, by the Four Horsemen or their elite agents.\n",

However, any character not already able to use spells gains one negative level for as long as the book is in her possession or while she uses its [[power]]. A book of infinite spells contains 1d8+22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by a d% roll: 01-50, arcane spell; 51-100, divine spell. Determine the exact spell randomly. Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back-paging through a book of infinite spells is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes. Once per day the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that is on the character's class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as scroll spells, nor can they be copied into a spellbook-their magic is bound up permanently within the book itself. The owner of the book need not have the book on her person in order to use its [[power]]. The book can be stored in a place of safety while the owner is adventuring and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its [[power]]. Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its use causes the page to magically turn despite all precautions.

      "Description: A deck of many things (both beneficial and malign) is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse. The character with a deck of many things who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. If the Idiot or Jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw additional cards. Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the Jester or the Fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A deck of many things contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are fully described below. Balance: The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level. Comet: The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level. Donjon: This card signifies imprisonment-either by the imprisonment spell or by some [[power]]ful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards. Euryale: The medusa-like visage of this card brings a curse that only the Fates card or a deity can remove. The -1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent. The Fates: This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation. Flames: Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days. Fool: The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Jester. Gem: This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, and the gems are worth 1,000 gp each. Idiot: This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional. Jester: This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Fool. The redraws are optional. Key: The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand. Knight: The [[fighter]] appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character. This [[fighter]] can be taken as a cohort by a character with the [[Leadership]] feat. Moon: This card bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of wishes shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of wishes (full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These wishes are the same as those granted by the 9th-level [[wizard]] spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received. [[Rogue]]: When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and made forever hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some [[power]]ful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect. Ruin: As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost. Skull: A dread wraith appears. The character must fight it alone- if others help, they get dread wraiths to fight as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a wish or a miracle. Star: The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities. Sun: Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated. Talons: When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably lost, except for the deck. Throne: The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour). Vizier: This card em[[power]]s the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within 1 year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another matter entirely. The Void: This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere-in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A wish or a miracle does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards.\n",

      "Description: This rare substance appears to be an ordinary, sooty piece of blackish rock. If the stone is broken open (break DC 20), a cavity is revealed at the stone's heart. This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables any character with at least 10 ranks in Craft (alchemy) to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single philosopher's stone can turn up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver (worth 25,000 gp), or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold (worth 50,000 gp). However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period. The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use. If mixed with any cure potion while the substance is still potent, it creates a special oil of life that acts as a true resurrection spell for any dead body it is sprinkled upon.\n",

If the stone is broken open (break DC 20), a cavity is revealed at the stone's heart. This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables any character with at least 10 ranks in Craft (alchemy) to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single philosopher's stone can turn up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver (worth 25,000 gp), or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold (worth 50,000 gp). However, the quicksilver becomes unstable once the stone is opened and loses its potency within 24 hours, so all transmutations must take place within that period.</p><p>The quicksilver found in the center of the stone may also be put to another use. If mixed with any cure potion while the substance is still potent, it creates a special oil of life that acts as a <i>true resurrection</i> spell for any dead body it is sprinkled upon.</p></h4></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DESTRUCTION</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h4><p>The philosopher's stone can be destroyed by being placed in the heel of a titan's boot for at least 1 entire week.</p></h4></div>\n",

      "Description: A sphere of annihilation is a globe of absolute blackness 2 feet in diameter. Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character. A sphere of annihilation is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of telekinesis, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain control of a sphere of annihilation (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Int modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action. Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere's speed in a round is 10 feet + 5 feet for every 5 points by which the character's control check result in that round exceeded 30. If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it. If two or more creatures vie for control of a sphere of annihilation, the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest.

      "Description: Each of these fabled Orbs contains the essence and personality of an ancient dragon of a different variety (one for each of the major ten different chromatic and metallic dragons). The bearer of an Orb can, as a standard action, dominate dragons of its particular variety within 500 feet (as dominate monster), the dragon being forced to make a DC 25 Will save to resist. Spell resistance is not useful against this effect. Each Orb of [[Dragon]]kind bestows upon the wielder the AC and saving throw bonuses of the dragon within. These values replace whatever values the character would otherwise have, whether they are better or worse. These values cannot be modified by any means short of ridding the character of the Orb. A character possessing an Orb of [[Dragon]]kind is immune to the breath weapon-but only the breath weapon-of the dragon variety keyed to the Orb. Finally, a character possessing an Orb can herself use the breath weapon of the dragon in the Orb three times per day. All Orbs of [[Dragon]]kind can be used to communicate verbally and visually with the possessors of the other Orbs. The owner of an Orb knows if there are dragons within 10 miles at all times. For dragons of the Orb's particular variety, the range is 100 miles. If within 1 mile of a dragon of the Orb's variety, the wielder can determine the dragon's exact location and age. The bearer of one of these Orbs earns the enmity of dragonkind forever for profiting by draconic enslavement, even if she later loses the item.

      "Description: The shinobi fuhonsen is [[sai]]d to have been the first payment ever made to a [[ninja]] in the history of Minkai. The tarnished bronze coin has a square central hole and bears six ideograms on its two faces-four on one face and two on the other, with two spaces apparently left blank. A leather thong is threaded through the coin's central hole, allowing the coin to be worn around the neck. The six ideograms on the coin correspond to six different skills: [[Acrobatic]]s, Climb, Disguise, Escape Artist, Perception, and Stealth. A DC 30 Knowledge (arcana) or DC 20 Linguistics check identifies the ideograms and their corresponding skills. The shinobi fuhonsen currently has six [[power]]s, each corresponding to one of the six ideograms and its associated skill. If a new owner has at least 8 ranks in another skill, the shinobi fuhonsen gains an additional [[power]] based on that skill, and a new ideogram emerges on the coin's surface. The new [[power]] and the skill it corresponds to are left up to the GM, though the [[power]] should be related to its skill, and the skill should be one on which the owner often relies. Although the existing [[power]]s of the shinobi fuhonsen are based on skills common to [[rogue]]s and [[bard]]s, new [[power]]s and their corresponding skills are not restricted to those of any one class. Only one new [[power]] may be unlocked per owner. The coin's [[power]]s only function for a worthy owner, who must have at least 8 ranks in each of the six skills, plus 8 ranks in another skill. If the bearer of the coin is not a worthy owner (i.e., does not have enough skill ranks), the coin vanishes from the bearer's possession at the next new moon, reappearing elsewhere in Minkai to seek out a new owner. When a new owner first takes possession of the shinobi fuhonsen and activates a new [[power]], the new ideogram (and its associated [[power]]) appears on the coin on a temporary basis, and the owner receives a vision of the coin's previous owners at the time of their deaths. If the new owner is not chaotic evil, he must immediately make a DC 25 Will save or his alignment shifts one step toward chaotic evil. If the save succeeds, the owner resists the change and can use the coin's [[power]]s until the next new moon, when he must make another save. The owner must make a new Will save at every new moon until his alignment becomes chaotic evil, or until the artifact is no longer in his possession. As long as the owner is not chaotic evil, he can simply discard the shinobi fuhonsen, at which point the coin vanishes at the next new moon. Once the owner becomes chaotic evil, the new ideogram (and its associated [[power]]) becomes permanent and he can no longer discard the coin, as if it were a cursed item. Each of the coin's [[power]]s can be activated by speaking the name of the corresponding ideogram, unless otherwise noted. The known [[power]]s (and their associated skills) of the shinobi fuhonsen are as follows. • Power #1 ([[Acrobatic]]s): The owner can cast shadow walk once per day. • Power #2 (Climb): The owner can cast spider climb three times per day. • Power #3 (Disguise): The owner is permanently under the effects of misdirection. • Power #4 (Escape Artist): The owner can cast dimension door three times per day. • Power #5 (Perception): The owner can cast scrying once per day. • Power #6 (Stealth): The owner can cast mislead once per day. • Powers #7-8 (8 ranks in another skill): Yet to be discovered.\n",

The daikyu of commanding presence is a +2 seeking composite longbow that adjusts its strength rating to match the Strength bonus of its wielder. Once per day, the wielder of the daikyu of commanding presence can fire a single arrow into the air, which illuminates the surrounding area with the effects of a daylight spell for 1d6 rounds. All allies within the daylight spell's area of increased illumination (120 feet) receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge, for the duration of the daylight effect.

In addition, a [[cavalier]] or [[samurai]] wielding the daikyu of commanding presence can use his challenge ability against a foe within the first range increment of the bow, and deals extra damage to the target of his challenge with arrows fired from the bow. The daikyu of commanding presence is an ancestral weapon of the Higashiyama family, one of the five imperial families of Minkai.

Until the elixir's duration ends, the drinker can only reattach its head to its body through the use of remove curse. The drinker's body is considered helpless while the head is unattached.\n",

A suit with a broken seal can be repaired with a DC 18 Craft ([[armor]]) check or a make whole spell. The suit does not compensate for changes in gravity. Wearing a pressure suit imposes a -1 [[armor]] check penalty; this penalty stacks with those provided by other equipment (such as [[armor]]).

You must declare this use after rolling the die but before you learn the result of the roll. You must expend all the ring's [[power]] at once.

Carved from single pieces of polished darkwood, they often display markings or symbols sacred to the deity of their creator, but can just as easily be plain and smooth. [[Plant]]ing a voidstick into the ground with an appropriate prayer is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The device floods the area with negative energy, producing an effect identical to the desecrate spell in a 20- foot radius. In addition, any evil divine caster within 20 feet of the voidstick may cast her spells without the need for any material component with a value of 10 gp or less, or any [[focus]] item with a value of 50 gp or less. This ability functions only for the individual planting the voidstick and persists until the stick is uprooted. While this is a useful tool for shamans in locations poorly serviced by trade in magical goods, it pales in comparison to the voidstick's most potent function: the creation of undead. Creating a voidstick zombie requires an hour-long ritual during which foul symbols are drawn across a corpse's flesh. At the end of the hour, the creator must make a DC 25 Knowledge (religion) check before driving the first voidstick into the victim's heart. If this check succeeds, the victim is transformed into a voidstick zombie. To fully animate the creature, one voidstick must be used for each Hit Die the base creature has. In 12 rounds, the creature rises under its own [[power]], eager to spread its negative energy and snuff out life nearby. [[Undead]] created using voidsticks are not under the control of their creator but can be commanded using channeled negative energy, spells, or similar effects. s can also be driven into a living body to slay the creature and transition it to undeath. If a living body is used, the creature must be pinned or otherwise helpless for the duration of the entire ritual. When the ritual is complete and the first voidstick is inserted, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save. If this save succeeds, the creature is reduced to 0 hit points and is dying, but the magic of the voidstick and the ritual are wasted and the ritual must be performed again, using another voidstick. If the save fails, the creature dies and the ritual is successful, transforming the base creature into a voidstick zombie.

However, in the hands of a craftsman with 6 or more ranks in the selected Craft skill, the greater [[power]] of the <i>amazing tools of manufacture</i> becomes apparent. The wielder may use the tools to create items using the Craft skill much more surely and quickly. The wielder may take raw materials with a value equal to half the price of an object to be crafted, and produce a finished object in as little as 1 hour for an item with a final cost of 2,000 gp or less. For objects with a final cost of more than 2,000 gp, the wielder can perform 2,000 gp worth of work in a single hour, but only once each day. Only a single skill check is required to successfully complete the item, made on the last day of crafting and gaining the +4 circumstance bonus granted by the tools.</p></h4></div><hr/><div><h5><b>CONSTRUCTION</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Requirements </b>[[Craft Wondrous Item]], [[Master Craftsman]]; <b>Cost </b>6,000 gp</h5></div>\n",

The halfling can, on following rounds, spend additional full-round actions to increase the object's weight by 2 additional pounds and its volume by another cubic foot. The halfling must succeed at an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item. If the halfling stops puffing on her pipe for any reason before she finishes creating the object, the figure in the smoke collapses and her pipe is extinguished. Objects created by solidsmoke pipeweed last for 24 hours before fading away into vapor. Objects created by the pipeweed have the same hardness, hit points, and other qualities as manufactured objects of their type, but look smoky and indistinct. Each pinch of solidsmoke pipeweed is sufficient for 3 full rounds of smoking. A single larger item must be created with a single pinch of solidsmoke pipeweed, so any item created with this pipeweed can't be larger than 9 pounds and 3 cubic feet. A halfling cannot create an object designed to exactly duplicate or replace another specific object. For instance, while she could create a smoky lock with its own key, she could not puff smoke into an existing keyhole and then create a key that would open that particular lock. This smoke is caustic and chokes non-halflings. It grants non-halflings no benefits, and each time they spend a standard action to smoke the pipeweed, they are sickened for 1 round.\n",

The lantern has no effect in an area that is already in dim light. Nonmagical sources of light, such as torches and lanterns, do not increase the light level in the lantern's area. Magical light or darkness only change the light level in the lantern's area if they have a higher caster level than the lantern. Once per day, the lit lantern of dancing shadows can be commanded to create quasi-real illusions from the shadows cast by its light, as the shadow conjuration spell. In addition, once per day, the lantern can be commanded to solidify shadows for a short period of time.

It has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground. Hobgoblin battle standards normally depict the device or insignia of a tribe or nation, and different types of standards grant different effects.

Despair: Enemies of the bearer of a hobgoblin battle standard of despair are sickened while within 60 feet of the banner. Any enemy that sustains a critical hit while sickened because of the standard must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15) or become dazed for 1 round. Ferocity: Allies of the bearer of a hobgoblin battle standard of ferocity gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws against mind-affecting effects as long as they are within 60 feet of the banner.

      "Description: A battle standard is a cloth flag or standard, typically 2 feet wide and 4 feet long, meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground. Hobgoblin battle standards normally depict the device or insignia of a tribe or nation, and different types of standards grant different effects. A battle standard may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the standard does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner. Despair: Enemies of the bearer of a hobgoblin battle standard of despair are sickened while within 60 feet of the banner. Any enemy that sustains a critical hit while sickened because of the standard must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15) or become dazed for 1 round. Ferocity: Allies of the bearer of a hobgoblin battle standard of ferocity gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws against mind-affecting effects as long as they are within 60 feet of the banner. Iron Resolve: Allies of the bearer of a hobgoblin battle standard of iron [[resolve]] gain 10 temporary hit points and the benefits of the [[Diehard]] feat for as long as they are within 30 feet of the banner. The temporary hit points can only be gained once per day per creature.\n",

Upon command, it transforms into a black raven (use the stats for an eagle) or a giant black raven (use the stats for a giant eagle). Both forms of the raven have [[Improved Steal]] (Advanced Player's Guide) as a bonus feat. The raven understands Common but cannot speak. It can answer questions related to its abilities or what it has seen by cawing once for \"yes\" and twice for \"no.\" The raven can maintain its non-figurine status for only 24 hours per week. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-hour increments. After three transformations into its giant raven form (though not its smaller version), the statuette loses all magical properties.\n",

      "Description: An intricately detailed miniature [[sai]]ling ship sits inside this clear glass bottle. When taken aboard an undamaged [[sai]]ling vessel at sea, the model automatically reconfigures to become a perfect replica of the new ship. It takes 24 hours for the model to attune to the ship. A ship attuned to an impossible bottle takes half damage from all attacks that deal damage. The model ship in the impossible bottle absorbs the remaining damage, registering holes in its hull, rips in its [[sai]]ls, and scorch marks from fire. Once the attuned ship gains the broken condition, however, the impossible bottle ceases its protection, and any further attacks on the attuned ship deal full damage. If the attuned ship gains the sinking condition or is destroyed, the impossible bottle shatters and is permanently destroyed. If an impossible bottle was attuned to a damaged ship, once that ship has been fully repaired, the impossible bottle re-attunes itself over 24 hours and thereafter resumes its protection. An impossible bottle removed from its attuned ship ceases its protection, and must be re-attuned over 24 hours if brought back on board. If the bottle is shattered while it is attuned to a ship, the impossible bottle is destroyed and the attuned ship immediately takes 150 points of damage. Lastly, an impossible bottle can be used to repair an unattuned ship. As long as the bottle still functions, its owner can christen a vessel by smashing the impossible bottle against the ship's prow, releasing a wave of restorative magic that immediately repairs up to 150 points of damage to the vessel.\n",

The undead created by the anchor are 1 Hit Die skeletons (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 250) that possess Profession ([[sai]]lor) scores of +7. Each skeleton can perform the duties of one crew member but has no other abilities. The skeletons cannot speak, attack, or even defend themselves. They are not proficient with any weapons or [[armor]]. The skeletons obey the commands of the ship's captain or pilot, but they only obey orders pertaining to the operation of a ship. A skeleton anchor can be used just once every 7 days to create up to 28 skeletal crew members. The skeletons do not count against the maximum total Hit Dice worth of undead creatures that the user can control. The skeletons act as crew for 1 week or until dismissed by the ship's captain or pilot. At the end of the week, the skeletons abandon the ship.\n",

Although made of gold, Chellan functions as an adamantine weapon for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction and bypassing hardness. Chellan is a +5 keen scimitar, and its density allows it to damage foes as if it were one size category larger than its actual size. It can be properly wielded only by characters with a Strength of 18 or higher-all other characters must either wield it as a two-handed weapon or take a -2 penalty on attack rolls with the weapon. Whenever Chellan strikes a foe, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or be slowed as per the spell slow (CL 16th). If the sword scores a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save or be turned into a crystalline statue, as if by flesh to stone. Characters turned to crystal by Chellan appear to be made of ruby, diamond, or some other valuable gem, but are in fact merely colored quartz of little value to looters. Fanatical in the extreme, Chellan seeks to force its wielder into serving Karzoug and furthering the runelord's goals.

      "Description: A paradox box resembles a small stone chest of ornate design that measures approximately 1-1/2 feet by 1-1/2 feet by 1 foot. Closer inspection reveals the paradox box to be a solid piece of stone that's been carved to resemble a box-it has no seam for a lid or hinges to allow opening. It is a secure storage device that can be accessed only by use of the proper command word or combination. Until the command word is intoned or the combination is correctly entered (the box's creator decides which method of opening works for the box-most boxes have combination locks that function similarly to the one detailed on page 9), the box is effectively a solid piece of stone with no lid or aperture or even an interior, and as such, attempts to open the box by bypassing a lock (with Disable Device or knock) do not work. Some creators also build magical traps into paradox boxes (summon monster traps are particularly popular), but these traps are not included in the standard model. Once the proper command is given, a seam appears around the chest, and nested hinges within allow this lid to open, revealing an extradimensional space 1 cubic foot in size. Anything that will fit completely within that space (regardless of weight) can be successfully stored within, and the chest can be sealed again simply by closing it. The contents of the storage space do not change the weight of the chest, since they actually stay in an otherwise inaccessible extradimensional space. If the chest is destroyed (hardness 8, hp 90), the extradimensional space collapses and any contents are jettisoned randomly into the Ethereal Plane. Paradox boxes were especially popular in Thassilon for their relative inexpensiveness as well as their superior security and durability. Many Thassilonian creators, burdened with arrogance and hubris, constructed their paradox boxes such that their surfaces were decorated with elaborate and carefully constructed riddles or wordplays that gave clues to their command words. These items are prize finds for organizations such as the Pathfinder Society, because a particularly clever investigator can often still open them, revealing their time-lost secrets even though the command word might have been lost millennia ago.\n",

      "Description: This 12-foot-high, 10-foot-diameter cauldron is made of solid iron, cast in one piece and thick enough to withstand great heat. Its side is marked with the [[Sihedron]] [[Run]]e, while many other Thassilonian runes grace its rim. A runeslave cauldron has the ability to infuse the body of a freshly slain giant, reviving it and transforming it into a runeslave (see page 412). Before it can be used, the runeslave cauldron must first be activated by filling it with a specially prepared broth of rare necromantic ingredients and rainwater collected from several open graves. The cost of the special ingredients is 10,000 gp, but once the cauldron is filled, a fire lights under it automatically and keeps the broth bubbling and functional for 1 year. Once the cauldron is filled with broth, one need only sacrifice a giant (the method of killing the giant is incidental) and then place the giant's corpse wholly or partially within the cauldron's bubbling contents. One hour later, the sacrificed giant rises from the cauldron as if true resurrection had been cast on it. In addition, the newly revived giant gains the runeslave template (see page 412). The cauldron can revive up to five giants a day in this manner. Non-giant corpses placed in the broth are unaffected by the cauldron's magic. Any living creature (save for a runeslave) completely immersed in the boiling broth inside a functional runeslave cauldron immediately takes 6d6 points of fire damage per round. In addition, the smoke produced by the cauldron as it boils is particularly noxious to good-aligned beings. It spreads to a radius of 30 feet around the cauldron, and while the smoke isn't thick enough to obscure vision, its foul-smelling vapors sting and burn those of good alignment. Each round such a creature remains in the smoke, he must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be blinded and nauseated for as long as he remains in the area plus an additional 1d6 rounds after leaving the area.\n",

      "Description: [[Run]]elord Alaznist, inspired by and jealous of Karzoug's success with the runewell of greed, experimented with variant runewells of her own design. Many of these minor runewells of wrath existed in her domain-though today most are lost deep under the waters of the [[Varisia]]n Gulf or are hidden away in Hollow [[Mount]]ain, with only the one remaining on mainland Avistan hidden in the Catacombs of Wrath under Sandpoint. Every time a creature with a wrathful soul (including most goblins and quite a few of the victims murdered years ago by Jervas Stoot) dies within a mile of a minor runewell, it gains 1 wrath point. There's no limit to the number of wrath points the minor runewell can store, but it currently contains only 20. Each time the well's waters are drawn upon (as detailed below), a number of wrath points are expended. If enough points are expended to put its total at 0 or negative wrath points, the minor runewell deactivates, its waters fading away. Reactivating the minor runewell requires long-lost rituals-or the reactivation of a major runewell somewhere else in the [[world]]. Such an event restores a minor runewell of wrath to a starting level of 3 wrath points. A minor runewell is only 3 feet deep, yet any living creature that enters its freezing orange waters immediately takes 2d6 points of cold damage and must succeed at a DC 15 Will save or be overcome with wrath. Failure indicates the creature becomes enraged (as if under the effects of a rage spell) and immediately attacks the nearest living creature. If no living creatures are in sight, the enraged creature is compelled to seek out a victim, moving at full speed in its search. This rage persists for 2d6 minutes, after which point the creature becomes fatigued. Each activation of a minor runewell in this manner costs 3 wrath points. A minor runewell can also be commanded to disgorge a sinspawn. To manifest a sinspawn, a creature need only allow a few drops of its blood to fall into the pool. One round later, a sinspawn emerges from the well and immediately attacks the closest creature in which it cannot scent wrath. Each use of a minor runewell in this manner costs 6 wrath points.\n",

      "Description: Currently hidden at the heart of the Eye of Avarice in a demiplane lodged between Leng and the Material Plane, Karzoug's runewell of greed is the key to both his escape from the destruction of Thassilon and his eventual return to life. The runewell itself is a core part of the Rise of the [[Run]]elords Adventure Path, but by the time the PCs arrive at the Eye of Avarice, the circular well (which appears to be filled with molten gold) has already done its job absorbing fragments of greedy souls and is in the process of using that energy to finalize Karzoug's escape. Beyond this effect, though, Karzoug can utilize the runewell in other ways. It grants him the ability to use scrying at will, although the runewell's range is limited to the Xin-Shalast region or to specific agents like Mokmurian, Xanesha, and Lucrecia. Creatures that wear magic items marked with the [[Sihedron]] take a -4 penalty on saves against this effect. The runewell allows Karzoug to see through the eyes and speak through the mouths of anyone who wears a [[Sihedron]] medallion (see p age 426). H e can also, given time, call up from the runewell a live adult blue dragon minion to serve him as an ally or mount. This essentially functions as a gate spell, save that the dragon is actually created by the runewell rather than called. Karzoug can only have one such dragon in existence at any one time, and must wait 8 hours after a previous dragon's death before calling a new blue dragon to serve him. The runewell itself is 10 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep. The liquid it contains functions in all ways as molten gold-dealing damage is if it were lava upon creatures splashed or immersed within it. Gold drawn from the runewell cools normally and is permanent-the runewell immediately replenishes gold taken from its supplies-yet this gold cannot exist more than 30 feet from the runewell's rim. If brought beyond this range, it vanishes in an instant.

Thus, Karzoug cannot use the medallion while it's worn by Nualia in Chapter One, as she is unknown to him, but once the PCs come to his attention later in the campaign, that may well change. See page 324 for more details on the ramifications of wearing a [[Sihedron]] medallion in Xin-Shalast.

The wearer suffers only half damage from vermin swarms and gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against the extraordinary abilities of vermin swarms. In addition, once per day on command, the wearer can transform the scarab breastplate into a swarm of scarab beetles that skitter from her chest to attack creatures nearby. This swarm has statistics identical to an army ant swarm (Bestiary 16) and attacks any creatures within its space. The wearer can command the swarm to move (including changing the shape of the swarm) as a move action, but the swarm must remain adjacent to her. If the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, if the wearer is forced to move away from the swarm, or if the wearer commands it to return to her as a move action, the swarm crawls back onto the wearer's torso and returns to [[armor]] form. While the swarm is active, the wearer is not considered to be wearing the scarab breastplate (except for purposes of commanding the swarm) and gains no defensive benefits from it. A [[druid]] of 6th level wearing a scarab breastplate can use her wild shape ability to duplicate vermin shape I (Ultimate Magic). At 8th level, she can also use it to duplicate vermin shape II (Ultimate Magic).\n",

This swarm has statistics identical to an army ant swarm (<i>Bestiary</i> 16) and attacks any creatures within its space. The wearer can command the swarm to move (including changing the shape of the swarm) as a move action, but the swarm must remain adjacent to her. If the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, if the wearer is forced to move away from the swarm, or if the wearer commands it to return to her as a move action, the swarm crawls back onto the wearer's torso and returns to [[armor]] form. While the swarm is active, the wearer is not considered to be wearing the <i>scarab breastplate</i> (except for purposes of commanding the swarm) and gains no defensive benefits from it. </p><p>A [[druid]] of 6th level wearing a <i>scarab breastplate</i> can use her wild shape ability to duplicate <i>vermin shape I</i> (Ultimate Magic).

As a move action, the wearer can snap a strip of wood loose from the [[armor]]. The strip lengthens into a weapon of a type chosen by the [[armor]]'s wearer. It can become a +1 greenwood club, a +1/+1 greenwood quarterstaff, or a +1 keen greenwood wooden stake. If the wearer creates a club or quarterstaff in this way, it gains the benefits of the shillelagh spell with a duration of 1 minute. Each weapon removed from the warden of the woods reduces the [[armor]]'s enhancement bonus by 1. Consequently, a maximum of three such weapons can be separated from the [[armor]] at any given time. The greenwood weapons keep their enhancement bonuses only while they're in the wearer's hands, though they remain masterwork weapons for other wielders. The wearer can reintegrate a weapon back into the warden of the woods as a move action and restore the lost enhancement bonus.

      "Description: This golden-bladed +1 glorious undead bane katana shines like the first rays of the morning sun. Whenever the wielder of a blade of the rising sun threatens a critical threat (regardless of whether the critical is confirmed or whether the target is subject to critical hits), the target is surrounded by a halo of golden sunlight equivalent to faerie fire until the beginning of the wielder's next turn. [[Undead]] surrounded by this glow take 1d6 points of damage at the beginning of their turn. The wielder of a blade of the rising sun may declare a sacrificial strike (similar to the retributive strike of a staff of [[power]]) as a standard action, or as an immediate action before losing [[consciousness]] upon gaining the dying or dead condition. A sacrificial strike converts the wielder's body and spirit into raw energy equivalent to a sunburst (DC 22). Allies of the wielder within the sunburst are not harmed, and the wielder may choose to affect all allies within the sunburst as mass cure light wounds or all allies within 10 feet as breath of life. The caster level for the effects of the sacrificial strike is equal to the sword's caster level plus 1/2 the wielder's level (maximum 25th level). A sacrificial strike destroys the wielder's body (as the spell disintegrate), but she has a 50% chance of being reincarnated (as the reincarnate spell) 24 hours after performing a sacrificial strike in a random safe location within 1 mile. The wielder's gear is left behind unharmed after the sacrificial strike; however, the blade of the rising sun is teleported to a random location at least 100 miles distant.\n",

When attacking a creature that is still bleeding from the bloodthirst dagger's wounding property, the dagger deals an additional +1 point of damage against the target for each bleeding wound the creature possesses (maximum +10). Whenever the wielder of bloodthirst confirms a critical hit with the weapon, she can choose to deal 1d6 points of additional damage for each still-bleeding wound the target possesses (maximum +5d6 damage). This additional damage is not multiplied by the critical hit, but is in addition to the damage normally added for bleeding wounds.
